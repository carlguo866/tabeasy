67	6	SLOW DOWN. Give the jury some time to process the information. You are throwing a lot at us and we have no prior knowledge of the case at all. You have very passionate hand gestures. Try standing up when giving the opening statement. It may fit your style better.  You just went through all 6 elements in 20 seconds. Really need to slow down to make sure the jury is following. \r\nGood structure for your opening. I can roughly tell how the opening is split into different parts (story, burden, witness breakdown). But you can definitely take use of body movement (again by standing up) to signify that you are switching to a new paragraph.	6	Ride or die, stand by or lie. You have great pacing. I don't really like the "Harry Potter" analogy. It made you look not too professional. Very great witness breakdown. They have to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt -- this is not exactly the same as what you said (they need to give you a million reasons to prove that...). The theme doesn't really fit what you are arguing in this case. It is a good rhyme, but make sure thye cover your whole case theory.	6	6	7	7	Adjust your camera angle a little to make sure that your head doesn't get chopped off. You have a great tone when you are explaining the concepts. I can see part of your hand gestures. But because of the setup, I can only see a small part of your hands when you are moving them. Tilt down the camera a little so that we can see your whole hand gesture.\r\n\r\nMake a slideshow containing the part of the report that you want the jury to see. Scrolling through the entire report made it really confusing cuz we don't know what to look for.	Even though the impeachment is on a small detail, you should still be familiar with your report.\r\n\r\nDo not argue with the opposing counsel. You were doing fine at the beginning of the cross. But it got really messy at the demo part. If the opposing counsel kept cutting you off, let your attorney do the job and object to that. Do not try to speak over the attorney. It made you look really fighty.	The witnesses are constructively sworn in already. You don't have to ask the first question. "What area do you specialize in" - This is a bit too early. Ask the witness something like "What do you do for a living". Good 702 response, you can definitely make your argument more concise though. You also don't have to lay 702bcd to tender the witness as an expert. 702a is all you need and you already did that. \r\n"Can you please identify this for me" -- "What is this?"\r\n\r\nStick with your ground as to this is not hearsay. "Stop him" doesn't have any truth value. By switching to excited utterance, you fed them a good LOF objection.\r\n\r\nAsk the question again instead of telling the witness to proceed to remind the jury what's the question. \r\n\r\nGood 8038 response. This should be your first response. Very nice job at pointing out that 8038b clause. But I do believe that the case law does forbid exhibit 2 and 3 from getting in. \r\n\r\nMake sure you protect your witness by raising an objection when she was cut off by the attorney from the other side. The one time you raised \r\n\r\nCounsel is testifying. The opposing counsel cannot just make comment on what the witness is saying.\r\n\r\nWatch your tone. You got really aggressive toward the end. This reflects on whether you are professional or not.	The 702 objection is well argued. However, it is my understanding that they don't have to lay foundation for 702bcd .\r\n\r\nREALLY GREAT HEARSAY OBJECTION! You are making really solid arguments. Good switch to the LOF objection when they brought up excited utterance. Make sure you sound confident throughout the whole objection battle. You sounded a lot less confident the second time around.\r\n\r\nAMAZING RESPONSE to the case law State v. Compton.\r\n\r\nI don't think you should have the "you even remember the speech" question in your cross. Whether or not she remembers the speech is really not relevant to this case at all. It's not worth the 2 mins to impeach the witness on this. At one point, \r\n\r\ncan you tell us what is it? -- don't ask open ended question.\r\n\r\nThe demo is way too messy. You have to find a way to set this up nicely to make sure that the jury can follow along clearly before it gets messy. You need to lay some foundation to first "paint the scene". \r\n\r\nDon't do the recross. The demo is already really messy. The witness is definitely going to fight with you on recross. it's not worth it.	7	8	6	6	I like how committed you are to the bartender character. But realistically speaking, I don't think you should be "at your job" while testifying in court. You can incorporate a little more character moments	You have an overall great demeanor in cross. Try to incorprate more character moments to make your cross next level	SLOW DOWN. Your script sounds really nice. BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO SLOW DOWN TO LET THE JURY FOLLOW ALONG. The ending is way too abrupt. You need to do some signpost and really really slowly present this to the jury.\r\n\r\nStay professional during objection battles. We can see you laughing at the camera. IT WAS OBVIOUS.\r\n\r\nDon't say "I believe", "I don't believe" during objection battles. "It is our (the proseuction's) contention that..." \r\n\r\nRead the judge when you are objecting. I have overruled every single relevance objection. So you really shouldn't be raising another one unless it's the absolute best argument you come up with.  \r\n\r\nMay Ms. Issacs be excused instead of making the decision of excusing her yourself. Only the judge can make that decision.		6	6	7	7	I saw an angry feeling doesn't really make sense LOL. Try to say something like he was throwing hands. His face turned red. Same comment for Detective, adjust your camera	Same comment about not being fighty	When the judge asks you to lay more foundation, do that as how you did it during the direct. After you think you've laid enough foundation, you can just move on to the next question. If the opposing counsel still believes that not enough \r\n\r\nsince you mentioned Ms. Bowman, can you tell me if there's anything strange about Ms. Bowman. -- this question sounds really "mocky". like it's so carefully crafted that she just happened to say that\r\n\r\nI don't think what Det Kimbell said can be entered under present sense impression. \r\n\r\nDO NOT EVER WITHDRAW OBJECTIONS\r\n\r\nSLOW DOWN WHEN YOU ARE OBJECTING. This is the part of trial that's not timed at all. You should slowly present your argument one piece at a time. When you got fast	GREAT OBJECTION ON LOPK. This was what I was looking for for that 403 objection too. The witness can testify to that the backdoor might be open, but she does not have the personal knowledge to testify to whether or not anyone escaped from the backdoor.\r\n\r\nOMG, this hearsay objection is really good. Very nice switch to LOF when they brought up the present sense impression argument.\r\n\r\nDon't say "The answer is yes." --> Repeat the question again.	7	5	7	6	Build up your emotions slowly. There were a couple moments in your direct when you just all of a sudden got really excited.\r\n\r\nI really like the passions you have in your direct. It shows that you care about the trial. But think about what character you want to present as.	I don't know if the\r\n\r\nDO NOT FIGHT WITH THE ATTORNEY. There's a difference between being explanatory and being fighty. Once you crossed the line, you will lose all the credibility among the jury. This is something really easy	Pay attention to the judge's ruling. The judge just said that you cannot come to the specific determination that Cam wanted to make money. This means that you cannot use this as the signpost in the next question "Why did you think Cam wanted to make money"	Stick with a specific statement when you are objecting. Don't just say as the court can find the witness constantly said "I guess". Name the specific statement and make your arguments.\r\n\r\nDon't say "interesting". Stay professional during cross and objection battle. One way to help is to also adjust your camera a little. There were moments when you were on the screen that you had to tilt your head to fit in.\r\n\r\nAnswer the judge's question. \r\n\r\nWhen you are trying to impeach the witness, don't let her take the control. Stick to what it says on the report. "Please read alone silently while I'm reading it out loud...", "Did I read it correctly?" if the witness fight --> "Ms. Bowman, DID I READ IT CORRECTLY" and then just move on. Do not move back to the question "so there's a discrepancy" cuz this is basically giving the witness a free chance to explain.	8	7	7	6	Decent direct. Try to plan out more gestures in your direct to keep it engaging. You are basically an expert witness. Your explanations were great.		Mention that for a piece of evidence to be excluded under rule 403, it needs to be  substantially more prejudicial than probative. Usually the judge will overrule the objection after they hear this	How did Poole profit from it --> Don't ASK OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS	7	7	7	7	HAHAHA I love the moments you have during objection battle where you pulled out the camera and "took" pictures		Weight not admissibility as to the LOPK objection		8	You have really great voice.

65	7	Good statement of the elements and good theme, but spoke a bit too quickly. Slow down and make pauses.	9	Great theme, good job on explaining the elements and burden. Unclear what the defense theory is. Alternative suspects? Accident? Used "they" to refer to the defendant.	7	7	7	9	Good testimony and gives a good explanation of the events. Spoke a bit too fast.	Referred to the attorney as "your honor". Should say "yes" instead of "yeah". Answered questions well, good credibility.	Good questions to guide witness testimony.  602 foundation objection on cross,  if the witness doesn't know, the witness should say that.	Great questions. Should use "headlining" to signal to the jury what you're talking about. Good job explaining the knife.	7	8	8	8	Good testimony, seems credible. Answers are very long. What do these numbers mean?	Good job answering questions, and maintaining credibility.	Witness should first talk about the exhibit before it's introduced. Referred to exhibit 7 as an affidavit, but it's titled as a profit sheet.?When the attorney takes down the exhibit, you should state this for the record.	Missed lack of foundation objection, Kimball said that she believes that no mistakes were made. Missed some nonresponsive objections to very long answers. Wait for the judge to let you speak before you explain your objection. Good job getting a "yes" from the witness	9	8	8	9	Good testimony, fun witness. Employees rate you badly?	Good job answering questions, lost credibility on favoritism for Kimball and tax evasion.	Good questions to guide the testimony. Entered exhibit 6, whenever the slide changes, you should state it for the record. Maybe don't say "here's some questions about ....", just ask the questions.	Good witness control, but try not to interrupt the witness. Interrupted the witness 3 times. Let her finish, and then redirect her to the question. Good job at getting the witness on taxes and threatening impeachment.	9	7	8	8	Fun witness, answers are directly responsive to the question.	Good responses to the questions, fun character, fought a little bit too hard to the bias point, lost credibility.	Good questions should pause after the witness answers the question. Good response to the hearsay objection. Good response to the second hearsay objection. "What did he say", will trigger a hearsay objection. Good lack of foundation obj, ask to be heard before you explain your objection.	Hearsay objection, but no statement was made. Good Speculation objection to who the guy was talking to. The judge's ruling is final. After the judge makes a decision on the evidence, do not object again, you can wait until you cross-examine to attack. Good Hearsay objection to the statement. Good job getting around the witness' answers.	8	7	7	9	Good testimony, answered questions well. Credible.	Maintained some credibility because of honest responses to questions. A bit too honest, admitted to a lot of bad facts.	Good questions, good tone.  For the hearsay objection, no statement was made. Try not to end examination on a sustained objection. See if you can think of one more question.	Lack of personal knowledge foundation, the witness can testify to not being a "people person" because they worked together. Hearsay obj, but no illicit statement was made, good 2nd 602 objection. Good 403 objection to "that's ridiculous", that statement doesn't have any probative value, but there is no grossly prejudicial effect.  Asked a compound question. Keep asking until the witness gives a clear "yes"	7	8	7	8	Trustworthy, some of the answers were nonresponsive.	Good responses maintained credibility. Admitted to not knowing Bowman well?	Good questions. Asked a leading question "you worked for her for four years", no foundation laid for who the boss is. Good job introducing exhibit 9, but this should be admitted early. When entering the exhibit, you should ask more questions to authenticate the evidence. How does he recognize it? Good speculation objection, but the argument goes to weight, not admissibility, wait for the judge to let you speak. 404 objection, is this being used for propensity? Vague objection.	Missed a leading objection, and a few lack of foundation objections. Hearsay objection to the bracelet, what is the truth value of the bracelet? What is it used for?	8	Say the theme slower. Good job restating the elements, and the facts of the case. Is it beyond a reasonable doubt or by the preponderance of the evidence? "We don't search for doubt, we search for the truth"	10	Good statement of the theme, charges, and burden. Like that the quotes in the closing are the same as in the opening. Good statement of the facts and bias of Longstreet. Don't say that a witness is "reliable", it can impede the province of a jury, let the jury decide who is trustworthy.	21	115	27	34	175	182	33	177	180	176	t

203	7	- "She knew, she planned and she lied"\r\n- Collusion with another employee and selling fake bracelets as real one \r\n- Movement for points\r\n- Hit on the lies sooner \r\n- I would bring up the indictment sooner. You broke it down perfectly and made it super clear. It would be helpful for the MOJ to have that breakdown before you go into the bulk of the story like you did at the beginning so they can follow the story and hear where the Defendant went wrong. Usually as a P attorney you'll want to bring up the charge right after a short introduction (maybe around minute 1 or 2 of the opening)\r\n- At some points it looks like maybe you're looking down \r\n- When you say phrases like "that's not true" say it more with an accusatory tone	8	-"three people, two cash books, one accident"\r\n- Great start with the pathos, you have your audience intrguid and your pace is great in variation\r\n- Claiming responsibiliyt for an accident \r\n- I think the elements slide is a bit too wordy --> on defense you want to make it super clear what P has to prove (makes it easier to attack their burden later)\r\n- I think if you want to emphasize the timeline in the opening, i would approach it before you get into your witnesses "MOJ, today I want you to pay attention to the timeline of the story the P is telling you. Bc x will take the stand today"	7	7	8	8	- I think your hand gestures add to your character but if you want to help accentuate the character even more, I would choose the specific places in the direct you want to use pointed gestures (it'll add to your character more and so)\r\n- When you get into the story about the robbery from the ticket booth I would slow down a bit when you get to some of the frightened emotions. Build up to the fright of hearing something like a gunshot (or if your character wants to play the emotion of shock then I would play up the facial expressions some more!)	- When you get asked the specific questions about the robbery ("you didn't see this, you didn't see that") I would go with a simple "no not that specifically, I was told that by Ms. Floyd" to sound less fighty and so that your story sounds less biased for \r\n- You can slow down his flow in the cross by slowing down your answers. Pause before answering and take a second to think just like you would in a day to day conversation!\r\n-I think fronting your bias is good! I would maybe rephrase it to be more like "sure, she never made the job	- Very kind demeanor with you witness this feels very conversational\r\n- I think you should've stuck with the argumentative objection, if he's using her own testimony against her I think the crossing attorney has the leeway to do that BUT the explanation you gave after the presider asked you was what you should lead with! Stick with your gut (it's usually right in objection battles)\r\n- When you object hearsay I would offer to explain! This may differ judge to judge but sometimes it's hard to keep track of the specific statement you are objecting to	- Obj under 702 to legal conclusion: I think this a well founded objection. I think this is a smart objection that you should continue making because even if it's overruled it's very clear that you are watching out for your client\r\n- I think there's a potential objection you can make to questions like "who should have been doing 'x' that day" perhaps to lack of personal knowledge or lack of foundation. We haven't heard foundation that she knows what employees were told what to do or their schedules (she didn't provide that foundation until the last question of her direct)\r\n-Very good start to the cross and a conversational tone\r\n- Sometimes you sway a bit when you're asking your questions even though you're asking some very hard hitting questions! The question "she didn't say anything about Ms. Whitman" - that's a big point! You should pause a little longer after she says no, and emphasize the 'anything'. You can even draw out that point - she didn't tell you whitman said x. Didn't tell you she saw whitman \r\ndoing 'y'. She didn't tell you anything about Whitman at all, did she?\r\n- I think if someone objects 403 to you on a cross you can jump to the first response being "YH, this question would have to be substantially more prejudicial than probative. This is cross examination, the witness can clarify what she heard but breaking down the credibility of this claim is probative to this case" \r\n-Sometimes you sway as you ask your questions and it distracts from the cross (also leads to things like crossing off the witness) but you have a well written cross and looking the camera in the eye adds to your command of the cross!	9	7	7	8	-You sound very passionate about your work and I believe your expertise! It was a little jarring to hear you talk about your father's death in with a happy tone haha so I would maybe change that tone to be more reflective or heartfelt (adds to making you both and expert and a real person!)\r\n-When you use a demonstrative, take some time to explain to the MOJ what we're looking at (it takes some time to digest a graphic) and also so it's noted for the record. I would say something like "If you look here, we have two columns, one for tickets sold and one for premium tickets" (I may have mixed those up) and then when you break down the numbers, throw in something like "because we see this 25% discrepancy between this column on the right and this column on the left, this means that theft was occurring". Really break down what we're looking at :)	- When you get asked about your experience with robbery cases I would answer very confidently and keep that confidence throughout the impeachment "yes I have experience with robbery cases", "exactly, I work in the financial and robbery unit, that's exactly what we do" - as an expert when you sound confident and like you genuinely are trying to explain something, you'll often win any cross question \r\n- I think you've started to lose some confidence as this direct went on but your demeanor on direct is so confident and poised! don't forget that when you're witnessing, you own the stand!\r\n- Try an answer like "That's correct ma'am, I only found evidence that Whitman was aiding Poole in robbing"	- You and your witness have a very good back and forth\r\n- This second graphic is very helpful and does a great job of exposing the defendant. I think bringing in the text messages in the middle of the demonstrative took away from the contradictions you were already talking about. The demonstrative feels stronger than the substance of the texts themselves\r\n-Good reraise to the hearsay objection. I think you are ultimately winning this impeachment - sound confident with the objection that no clear contradiction has been made.	-Ohhhh yes!! A lot of confidence in your initial response that was great! I would say succinctly which prongs of 702 you are objecting too though so they don't get to re explain all the education the expert has (Are you able to object to prong B,C or D? I know sometimes the case says these are already fulfilled but usually I do think there are a lot of objections to be made there! we haven't heard about their method at all or if they applied it reliably)  - they lay this foundation later but you can't enter the witness as an expert until this foundation is laid\r\n- Is there a potential objection we can make to some of these statements that someone told this detective they were threatened? Even with 703 you could argue that just because it's related to Poole doesn't mean it goes towards the Detective's conclusion today about Whitman\r\n-very very good catch with the 703! it just for testimony and not for entering evidence, that was a great response \r\n-Great job choosing to start with an impeachment and leading into the impeachment with the accusatory questions. I would emphasize them even more: "you had up until today's trial to change it?" and really slow down when you say words like "up until" or phrases like "you swore" - makes it look even worse if there is a contradiction\r\n-This impeachment is what I think you were trying to get at when you offered a voidire earlier. If this is a point you want to cross on regularly then I would bring this up in a 702 objection "YH, we have it on a good faith basis that this witness has no experience in investigating robberies and therefore is not qualified as an expert to provide the subsequent conclusions on robbery"\r\n- OOOhhh this bias pocket is bad for defense! Hit it even more. Drag it out and maybe even throw in a hand gesture to emphasize how this bias can affect the credibility of this witness! owing the victim is a veryyyy interesting point\r\n- I wouldn't let her get away with answer like "I saw it for myself" unless she absolutely can say that. It sounded like it was the end of a pocket and I would make sure that at the end of each of your pockets (or 'topics' if you will) that it's on a question they can't disagree with \r\n-Just watch out for shaking your head during an objection. Even when you're confident that you're right :)	8	8	8	8	-It's so clear you're having fun with this character, I enjoy!! I would slow down just a littttle bit, especially when you get to the jokes (like the start and stop joke) so that the jury can process it and enjoy your character even more!\r\n- Some answers are just a tad too long (the response where you're describing the three times Whitman asked to take over the ride). I would cut maybe one of the jokes in there so that the substance of the answer (Whitman asking to take over) is what the jury ultimately remembers	-When she asks you a question like "you didn't hear a gunshot sound on your first day" you have complete leeway to make that a character moment! Of course someone would remember if they heard a gunshot or not\r\n-overall, well done! When an attorney starts to get aggressive with you don't let them take away from you shining on the stand - slow them down and throw in a character moment with confidence (maybe script one in if you know you'll be asked some of the same questions each round)	-Very lighthearted approach \r\n-Don't forget you need to note for the record the changes that are being made to the demonstrative. This could mean the witness says something like "You can see those buttons right next to the arrows here" (it's small but technically the record has no note that you're pointing those things out)\r\n-Small but I would rephrase the last sentence to be like "Thank you for your time Ms. Isaacs, have a great rest of your day" (just flip the order that you said it)\r\n-With the hearsay objection, you need to say what part of the timeline you don't want reflected on the record. What is the specific statement on this timeline that is out of court? I think if you got to a specific timestamp or believe there was a contradiction in the timeline then that's what could get you the hearsay argument	-When a witness like this one has less stake in the turnout of the case or plays a kind character then I would enter the cross a little less combative because then their friendly demeanor is what the jury remembers more than any damning response. I think you can let that tone build up throughout the cross (the tone you had by the end of your cross was well done because it flowed into your timeline - I would start the cross more casually and build to that tone!)\r\n-Great demeanor despite the connectivity issues. I know that kind of thing can be stressful but you handled it with grace and hopped right back in!\r\n-Good response to the hearsay. For the record to reflect isn't inherently hearsay just because it's a demonstrative. Harp on the fact that these are in court statements	9	10	7	8	-Great start! you sound very confident from the get go. I genuinely believe that you are the character you're playing \r\n-Great start and stop with the objections, when the objection happens I'm genuinely left wondering what you wanted to say \r\n-There was one answer you made that ended on an unnatural note, I think it was "let me tell you it was dark!" and then you waited for the next question. Just give the. explanation before that remark to make it more natural (think - how would you tell a story in real life about this? would you wait for someone to ask you the details? Usually not)\r\n-Great job adapting your testimony following the motion to strike. You got the same substance you needed out while avoiding a reraise	-I think you can make a joke about someone asking you if you're good at math (it sounds like a silly question when a jury first hears it and I assure you many people aren't good at math) so you can easily brush off those questions with something like "oh no, I like to consider myself more of a woman into writing" or "no, of course not, that's not my expertise" or something similar. It makes sense for you not to know these things	-Your witness is very high energy, I would match that a little more and have some of those early questions be more like two friends conversing as the MOJ get to know your witness\r\n-Overall great job making your witness shine, I would recommend having some more concrete responses for the LOF objections because those will definitely come up again (or switch the order in your direct so that the foundation comes before the witness's answer)	-Very good LOPK obj., I would harp on even more on she can't know if it's 'juicy' if she wasn't there, didn't hear it, etc. (I may have missed this part but if she does have that information then I would be prepared to also object just to LOF)\r\n-I think this second LOPK is more of an LOF objection. It sounds like she may have this knowledge (LOPK is used when we don't think there is a way for them to know) but it's definitely LOF - we have no idea what she saw and why it qualifies as 'dark'\r\n-This is definitely objectionable for the testimony that something is unreasonable BUT i would say that's it's actually 702 or a 403. She's not stepping into someone's mindset under speculation but this is a conclusion that could prejudice the jury when she's only a lay witness (he sustained the speculation but be prepared for a judge to ask you to reraise a different obj.) - good job asking for motion to strike\r\n-I would save more aggressive witness controls like "my questions can be answered with a yes or no" for after a witness is clearly fighting just to fight. I think her fighting wasn't abrasive at that point so it comes off more like an attorney being combative with a kind witness who has low stakes in this case\r\n-I would cut the second part about math when you ask about 3 being less than half of 7 (I think you meant it as a joke and a way to be kind with the witness but it can come off the wrong way with certain judges)\r\n-Good job redirecting the witness back to the timeline and ending on the point that the witness wasn't there the day of the crime\r\n-A well noted objection during redirect	8	8	9	9	-Just based on initial vibes alone I do love this makeup and get up \r\n-Slow down when you do your witness introduction, it sounds like you have a very friendly and thought out character so I would slow it down so the MOJ interact with you more	-Great job being agreeable and not fighty (i would vary up how you agree a little bit more - "yes", "exactly", "you've got that right"\r\n-Sometimes you would start to go quieter at the end of your sentences which can come across as though you are less confident in your responses\r\n-Great intonation, speed variation and passion	-You're exactly right about rule 803(3), I would jump right to it when you object "YH under rule 803(3) statements of intent or a plan like this one are an exception to hearsay" but nonetheless very well argued\r\n-When you profer just say that 'we will hear' instead of 'we will prove to you' - it's small but will sound even more polished to the judge. You're proving your case this entire trial, not just now :) \r\n-Great repertoire with witness	-There's an LOF objection you can make to the witness saying comments like 'it was shady' without giving any context first. It's adding to their CIF and biases the jury but she didn't provide any reasoning before she said it \r\n-I really like the question "the only person with this nickname is Wit"\r\n-You have very poised witness control, that was a very good threat of impeachment in terms of tonation and execution	8	7	8	8	-I genuinely believe you are this character, you have a good balance of sounding indignant\r\n-The sentence "his name is carl by the way" was a bit of a disruption to the flow of the story you were telling\r\n-The transition from talking about your backstory to talking about Cameron Poole was a bit jarring, is there a way to introduce Cameron Poole a bit more that connects back to your intro story? in an emotional sense?\r\n-I would choose one or two places in the direct that you want to be the emotional arc.	-I think you've got to pick and choose (like in direct) which moments in cross you want to be emotional on because otherwise the transition from sympathy to more combative or in denial more jarring	-You're doing a good job of letting the defendant take lead \r\n-If there's a way to singpost a bit more or pause before you begin another part of the story it can help the MOJ follow a bit more (I think if you have the space in your room to move or even if it means using a hand gesture when you switch to the next event in the story so the MOJ can note when a question is very important)\r\n-The question about hitting the wrong control can have a bit more sympathy. We know where the story is headed and we know it's an emotional part for the witness. Before and after this question slow down, be gentle with the witness and match her tone. It helps with the flow of the story and humanizes your witness more\r\n-Just watch out for the party opponent statements (defendant crossers will always pull out quotes from the witness)\r\n-I think you're right here about the hearsay objection. Highlight that it says the relation is to statements not an arrest report itself which is created by a police officer	-I wonder if there's an objection you can make to comments like "a lot of people slack off, or don't come, etc." if the defendant says something like that. Like maybe an LOPK? or Spec to the other workers? maybe you could even try a 403\r\n-I think a comment like "I've paid the price" can also be the opportunity for either a 403 or even a 702 under legal conclusion (a jury decided what the right price to pay is in a legal sense / her perception of whether she's paid the price only serves to make the jury sympathize with her but doesn't add probative value)\r\n-Good gentle tone starting - it makes the ramp up that much more effective\r\n-Very good job establishing the first element of knowledge\r\n-When you get to the 'you never asked Cameron Poole for money' try a rephrase like 'you're saying you never asked Cameron Poole for money?' ..."Well he started paying for your lunches right"..."starting paying for 'x'"..."started paying for those things after you found out he was stealing?" -- you can ramp up the speed too to show the contradiction the jury should follow \r\n-With the defendant you can sound more accusatory when you start to threaten impeachment\r\n-If possible, could be pretty cool if you had like a legal pad you can lift up and say something like "I want to talk about something you said during our trial today" (good response to objections to Whitman's statements)\r\n-Don't forget to have the witness authenticate the document! They can recognize a document but also have to state that it's the same one it was before\r\n-While I think on technicality I agree with Defense on the hearsay objection I think you argued you're side well (I do think arrest reports don't fall wholy under 'statements')\r\n-I would pause after that last answer. She just admitted that she lied and you can let that answer sit for a bit more before saying 'no further questions'	9	-Good passion through out, very good ramp up in intonation \r\n- You're closing seems to be mostly based on the theme of lying and I missed some of the 'she knew' and 'she planned'\r\n-Make sure to spend some more time on the burden in closing --> it's the opportunity to show the MOJ that you've met each element and as P that's the most important\r\n-Good rebuttal - great adaptation to opposing counsels closing and great passion --> connect this back to your elements of the burden to really bring it home!!	9	- I really like how this closing is organized by your theme and how you got to the burden at the start\r\n-When you start to talk about Whitman, you can humanize her more by slowing down in this section.

77	6	"the wrong is never right" -- okay theme, but it's a bit generic... couldn't this apply to any criminal case?; "may it please the court?" should be the first thing you say since you're essentially asking the judge if you can start; clear intro -- good job laying out the narrative and the case clearly from the start; since this is an opening and you should be *previewing* the evidence rather than simply stating facts or making arguments, you need a few more "you'll see" or "you'll hear today" type phrases; good on burden of proof and elements of the crime; defendant's actions were "deliberate, dangerous, doubtful" great -- I really like this... in fact, I wonder if you want to make this your theme?; a few too many "pleases" towards the end; good repetition at the end	8	"they needed a fall guy and here we are" I like this theme, but would probably simplify to "they needed a fall guy" -- best themes are short and simple; good intro, but make sure it doesn't get too far into argumentative territory -- you were right on the line here; "they claimed to have a doubt beyond reasonable" awkward phrasing; I didn't find the first demo particularly effective; great questions! also, I really liked putting the questions on a demo -- my only suggestion to improve is to make the demo more visually interesting by using your team's graphic design skills (it can be as simple as playing around with colors, fonts, a few graphics, maybe checkmarks or something like it, etc.); I like the rhetoric about our constitution's guarantee of a free trial -- this can be polarizing but I think it's really effective; cut some of the legalese re. "having a legal duty to prevent the commission of an offense" -- phrase all of this in simple, lay terms so ordinary people can easily understand	7	7	6	9	I would move all but the first sentence of your first answer to another question -- keep it short and simple when you introduce yourself; good job trying to help your atty. out a bit when you got objections to the document; creative but a little awkward way of slipping your theme into your testimony	I wouldn't try to explain your prior answer when he asks you if your affidavit was made under penalty of perjury -- I would wait until he reads the line and asks if he read it correctly to explain	803(8) (public records exception) usually only applies to records from government offices; if you want to enter a doc under 803(6) (business records exception), you need to ask the witness a series of 3 or 4 foundational questions to establish each of the prongs of 803(6) (go look at the rule to see exactly what you need to show)	good job repeating and clarifying what in the witness's answer you're objecting to; great job re. the hearsay obj. to the employee manual; great catch re. when the doc was last revised, but it's a weird spot to be put in as a mock judge -- most judges are probably going to say you should cross on it; make sure you don't object to party opponent statements; great job impeaching the witness on the issue of revising the employee manual that I signaled you might want to do during the objection battle; great impeachments; "let's get back to the cross exam" a little awkward sounding -- I wouldn't say this; try to avoid cutting off the witness unless they're totally rambling -- a lot of judges where I come from will consider this rude; great bias points; the cross went on a little long -- keep it short and impactful, make your point, then sit down; re. $25 vs. $75 tickets and taxes -- if you want to make this point, I would walk the jury through the math on this like they're 5 year olds... keep in mind that most jurors won't understand the math unless you explain it as clearly and simply as possible	5	4	6	8	speak up -- it's just a little hard to hear you at times	make sure all of your answers are as clear as possible; you need to fully answer every question; make sure you know the case materials backwards and forwards so you know exactly how you want to answer every question	FYI, I'm not scoring based on pronunciation, but Racheter is pronounced ROCK-tur (it's the name of someone, Don Racheter, who was a co-founder and prior president of the American Mock Trial Association); good job with the 602 obj.; be careful with badgering the witness objections -- they rarely win and a lot of judges don't like them, so I would avoid unless the badgering is pretty egregious	good 602 obj.; great job controlling the witness on cross; make sure you don't cut off the witness though -- a lot of judges (and jurors) will consider that rude; good job laying foundation for 803(6) (business records exception) on the profit and loss sheet; good job adjusting to the witness; nice use of the profit and loss sheet	8	6	7	8			good foundation at start of direct	I like the offer to voir dire, but I think you're a little too laser focused on whether she has a college diploma -- the language of Rule 702 of allows her to be qualified by "knowledge, skill, experience, training or education"; you're getting pretty tied up in the weeds on cross	8	7	8	6	this is an interesting accent -- I'm not sure what it is but it's interesting; this is pretty entertaining as a character actually		scribblings not for truth value; when he points them out, I would have him actually mark on the doc rather than just use the mouse to show them	I wouldn't make the hearsay obj. to the photos of the control panel; make sure your questions on cross are as clear and simple as possible	9	8	8	8	good use of photos; this is a fun and understated character -- you seem like a real person and that will get you points	natural-sounding answers	good use of photos; good signposting; "no offense" I appreciate the attempt to introduce this topic in a bit of a softer way, but I don't think this is necessary	I don't think you really need to introduce the cross with something like "I'm going to ask you a few questions"; short, pointed questions -- good; good signposting; I know it can be tough depending on the time of day, but try to bring the energy up a couple levels; short and sweet -- good	10	8	7	8	I know it's tempting, but I don't think it works in your favor to put this witness in a jumpsuit -- it heavily implies that they're guilty/a criminal -- any criminal defense attorney in real life is going to put their client in a suit and a judge would likely not even allow a defendant to go on trial in a jumpsuit... A+ for costume creativity, though, and I might very well pull out the jumpsuit again for a cooperating gov't witness in future; great emotion on direct and very natural-sounding answers		good, clear questions; cut filler words like "right"; good job walking through the story; I wouldn't say "the last question" -- that almost invites the other side to object	"let's talk about that" great; I really like the intro to this cross; good job attacking her credibility; make sure all of your questions are closed-ended, leading Q's	9	"deliberate, dangerous and dubious" good job bringing this back from opening; "you learned X, Y, Z" good phrasing to point out specific testimony in trial; "don't take our word for it, take the defendant's" good; good re. coincidences but you can phrase this point a bit differently to make it more impactful; for a rebuttal, I think the best strategy is often to pick one thing they talked about in their closing that was particularly impactful and argue your side of that point	9	good, clear intro; very clear delivery; good use of presentation techniques like voice modulation, pauses, gestures, etc.; good re. mistakes; good job going back to specific testimony and moments from trial	19	155	158	155	93	157	159	156	154	96	t

80	9	You had a clear storyline but I would consider adding more imagery. You want the jury to feel like they are experiencing the moment. I am very impressed by your comfort in giving a speech you have a lot of talent but,  be more purposeful with your movement and change up your tone/volume.  "She knew, she planned, she lied" is a good theme but I didn't understand it until too late in your speech.  Make sure you're saying "the evidence will show"	7	I like that you started with the story but had a harsh transition into the rest of the speech. I don't remember hearing a theme but your theory was very clear.  There was a lot of room for more storytelling so going forward make sure you're telling a more vivid story.  Go through the witnesses one by one rather than listing all three at once.  Avoid saying "that's all" this is a formal setting.	7	7	9	7	You were an amazing witness, and very entertaining to watch. Some of the things you said were nonresponsive and objectionable so make sure you're being calculated about what you're saying.	Watch your facial expressions during objection arguments. Technically you are not supposed to be hearing the argument. Try to find a balance between being believable and still fighting back. Sometimes you were non-responsive. Lost some of your character on CX, keep the personality!	You are very conversational and I am, again, incredibly impressed by your comfort during direct examination. Your witness said a lot of objectionable things and you asked a few leading questions. Make sure you're not misstating the witness. All of these things can/will face objections at some point. Good job breaking up the flow with objections and very well-worded objections.  Be more deliberate with your objections because you did make a lot. Amazing job!!!	You missed a lot of objections on direct examination. Make sure you're familiar with Do not say "first of all." Be more formal in the courtroom.  I loved your questions and I think if you worked on delivery you would be a very very very strong crossing attorney. Be more comfortable with the rules of evidence, especially if you're going to be asking objectionable questions. Confidence will carry you far in mock trial. Have a backup question if your last one is going to be objectionable.	8	7	8	6	You were a very well-informed witness but try to bring some personality through.  Since you clearly knew the material, you can have more wiggle room for adding some personality to the witness. Experts should be able to engage the jury (the demo was a good idea) because they have the densest material to cover.  Sometimes it felt like you were just reciting a script, make sure you're being conversational.	You did say a lot of objectionable things but you got away with it so I won't bug you on that. Great job on cross it was pretty short so I didn't get to see you really shine but I think you maintained your composure well.	Make sure you're listening to what's going on during objection arguments. If the judge wasn't paying attention you may have to fill in the gaps.  Good job doing all the courtroom formalities, stating for the record, etc. these things are very important. You have a very nice tone for experts and I enjoyed this direct.	Make sure you're listening to objection arguments. Be more confident during objections, that is your time to shine before CX starts. Untimely objection. Practice your courtroom mannerisms. You should be more assertive on cross, this is your moment and the witness will try to take that from you. Why such a short cross?	9	10	10	7	Nice accent, very entertaining witness. Sometimes very non-responsive so be careful. You didn't face any objections but you might. "Meemaw" was a good line. Very believable witness.	I don't have any complaints about your performance on cross. Good job.	You own this zoom courtroom and I can tell. Great movements and great job utilizing your space in the zoom box.  Very articulate in your objection responses. I don't have any negative things to say about your performance.	I love your confidence but you lost it along the way. Make sure you're paying attention to what's going on.  Good job objecting to break up the DX flow but make sure you're making clear/important objections.  On DX, the witness was very nonresponsive and speculative, those would have been more effective objections. Why such a short cross?	6	4	6	9	This is a perfect witness to have some fun with the personality. It came through a little but not as much as I would have hoped. Don't say you can't remember your client's names or that you can't remember things, it ruins your credibility as a witness. Delete filler words like "um" "like" etc. Very nonresponsive witness. Add more questions to your direct because your answers are way too long.	You seem very nonchalant a lot of the time, avoid putting your head on your hands and your tone.  Avoid laughing as well. Don't fight on the impeachment, it destroyed your credibility. It seemed like you didn't know your affidavit that well, make sure you're prepared to answer cross-exam questions.	Avoid saying "I want to ask" just ask the question. Be prepared for objections. Getting more comfortable with the rules of evidence is the best thing you can do for yourself.  For example, you responded relevance to a narrative objection. Delete filler words like "um" "like" etc.  Be more confident! Don't be afraid to object on CX (do not object to leading) , you may have to protect your witness if they are struggling. Just say "objection your honor" not "your honor may I get an objection"	Very articulate and good objections. The bolstering objection was okay,  I might've gone with character evidence but your theme is built on character evidence. If you notice a judge starts to overrule your objections a lot, limit how many you make (aka make sure they're really important) and deal with the rest on cross exam. I am very impressed with your witness control on cross-exam, and you knew exactly when to push her and when to move on. Good impeachments. I think you could've had more fun with this cross, the witness was saying some questionable things that you can definitely use to your advantage.	7	6	7	8	You knew what you were talking about but it did look like you were reading at some moments so try to be memorized! When you are memorized, you have more room to have some personality with the witness.	You can fight more on cross. Try to take the attention away from the attorney.	Nice confidence even during objection battles, but I think you got worn out through the DX. Sometimes you will face an opponent that objects a lot, making it seem like it doesn't bother you at all.  Make your questions less wordy. Pay attention to what is going on during the trial. Overall I think you had good DX questions. Do not object leading on cross examination.	Good objections but excessive at times. Make sure that the things you're objecting to NEED to be kept out and know what exactly you're objecting to. VERY confident on cross I am impressed. Short cross :(	7	7	8	7	I enjoyed this witness, I couldn't tell if there was a British accent? You played a sympathetic witness well it is very hard to play the defendant and you did a good job. Watch your movements, touching hair, facial expressions, etc. Everything you do/say as the defendant matters. Stop talking when there is an objection.	Just because the attorney makes a face does not mean you have to stop talking. If he doesn't interrupt you take advantage of that BUT do not talk excessively. Do not ask "is that a leading question," Your witness would not know what that is. And just for reference, you can ask leading questions on cross-examination.  You can defend yourself but do not get offended/be too sassy because it ruins your credibility. Slow down and think about what you're going to say. I think you got frustrated towards the end and it is reflected in your attitude, this cannot happen as the defendant.	Ask the witness to introduce themselves before jumping into the facts. You want the witness (ESPECIALLY the defendant) to build a relationship with the jury and a lot of how they do that is talking about who they are, what they do for a living, etc. Always repeat the question after an objection gets overruled, it brings the attention back to you. Don't say "next question" and delete all filler words/phrases from your vocabulary. Asked some leading questions. Much more confident during this direct than during your cross and opening :) The second impeachment was objectionable. Fight for your witness, if she's struggling you can redx or help her out!	Good objections but excessive at times. Make sure that the things you are objecting to are necessary to keep out. WATCH YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS (On DX and CX). You lost your confidence after having some objections overruled, just move on. Do not let it frustrate you. Slow down and make every word you're saying important (sometimes you trip over your words and get nervous/shy but if you slow down that won't happen). Make your arguments shorter and make sure you are very familiar with an objection before making it do not be flippant with them. Good cross, I am again impressed with your command of the courtroom (try to keep that energy during objections!). Nice witness control, and nice job being responsive to the DX. Nice impeachments (second one was iffy but you got away with it). Questions are too wordy and the cross was way too long.  If the judge says to wrap it up... wrap it up.	8	It is definitely a stylistic choice to start the closing with such a strong tone, but I don't think it is effective. Once you softened your tone, it was easier to connect with you. Slow down slow down slow down. I liked that your theme had three prongs and then you argued each one separately. I like that you changed your tone/speed/volume throughout the speech but you need to be more calculated. When you sped up it was too fast, and when you got louder it was too loud. Find a happy medium. Great courtroom presence yet again but I think you had too much movement during this speech. Yes, you should take up space but it should be on purpose. Good use of the demonstrative in your closing. Your rebuttal metaphor about the water should've been included somewhere in your speech. The rebuttal was not responsive to the defense's speech.	7	"I speak in here, in this court" I liked that first line it was very impactful. I think it would be more impactful at the END of your speech.  I think your arguments were really clear, I loved the contrast between the bad salaries and the chanel bags! A lot of your case is built on character evidence and if you're going to go with that route then you need to offer it in a way that does not seem like it's just "she was a good kid so why would she do this". I am still unclear on what your theme is so I was a bit confused. I don't think a lot of your closing argument came out during trial so make sure you're being responsive. You have a natural talent for giving a speech. You are a good storyteller and would make a good opener.	25	116	144	142	223	222	147	146	143	227	t
35	7	I appreciate your storytelling. Maybe a little more than a few keywords at the beginning were needed to make the case theory one-liner work. I sometimes cannot hear you pronouncing the end of your sentences.  I would try to enunciate every word more clearly. I did require that every single time before visuals are shown, ask for permission. They were shown a little too briefly.	9	Great body language. "Possibilities" is a pretty good case theory. You enunciated very clearly while being passionate. I always appreciate a zealous advocate. "Certainty, not possibilities" is good.	7	6	8	7	I appreciate the effort at a reasonably credible Russian accent. The "military commander" thing is kind of too repetitive after three times, and talking about being Russian over and over again involves unnecessary stereotyping.	You said "that's a possibility" which sounds like the defense case theory, which is a rather bad look.	This seems like a drunk witness who might not be so credible, so it's an interesting choice to put her forward first.  Very good responses to objections.	Good attempt at an objection.  Building up the story to damage the witness's credibility is good, saying she's not careful.  If you would let go of the point as to who sneak in, then don't push it so hard so that I expected an impeachment. I would cut down on some of your comments that seemed a little extra and possibly not so professional.	9	8	7	9	I like this Instagram influencer vibe for a spoiled kid owner of an amusement park. Your performance was spot-on.	Your delivery of lines was very good.	Calm and professional demeanor. Picked up the foundation issues very well.  Foundation objections are not appreciated unless it's an egregious issue.  Some other unnecessary objections were in there.	Very clear and argumentative in a good way.	6	6	9	5	There is no need for a whole lecture on the lack of gender diversity in police in this case because it doesn't really benefit you here. I wouldn't say "from my look, people don't think I'm professional."	Calm and composed.	Very clear and professional. Very familiar with the Rules of Evidence.  You reacted very quickly.	You objected to her expertise in "criminal cases" when they were trying to establish expertise in financial crimes, which caused confusion. Financial crime is a "criminal case." You also talked back at the judge after a ruling which is a big no-no.	8	6	7	9	Very passionate witness. Always in character.	You tried to dodge some questions, but sometimes that's not the best strategy.	Good body language and persona of a defense attorney. Your handling of the objection procedure could be more professional.	Very clear in objection responses. Respectfully pressing the witness to get your point across is great.	7	7	9	7	Consistent persona. Please avoid nodding or reacting when an objection is ruled or your attorney is making a good point.	There was some unstrategic hesitation.	Don't say "that's unfortunate." That was objectionable, unlike something like "that's impressive" in response to immaterial witness testimony. Otherwise, very professional and clear. Easy to follow your questioning. Good ending.	This was a rather short cross.	8	7	6	9	You made a reasonable effort to lay the lacking foundation after an objection was sustained. Your emotional response was also credible.	I wouldn't deny "needing money." I would focus on denying being a criminal.	Don't give up an objection fight; if you have to, rephrase the question instead of quitting. Don't just tell your witness to calm down. Be patient and nice when the witness is emotional. You were holding your legal pad in front of your nose and you could have spilled confidential attorney work product accidentally by doing that.	Powerful and professional. Don't say "you grew up in a bad community" which sounds like profiling. You pushed the defendant into a corner which is the right thing to do for a prosecutor.	10	Powerful. Great body language.	6	I usually appreciate a passionate defense attorney, but being too aggressive might be counterproductive. "My client" might sound too protective. "When does liking money become a crime" might be a line that land in the wrong way for different people. Don't roll your eyes.	14	98	76	210	78	77	83	207	209	80	t
204	7	- "The absence of light is not the absence of justice." - theme?\r\n-  Good, clear tone and voice\r\n- Introduction is a little bit metaphorical and dramatic--it helps to use more concrete, relatable language\r\n- Presentation for statements especially is always better if you can stand and not use notes--because you are sitting, I cannot tell whether or not you are reading your statement\r\n- Good laying out the story of what happened from your side's perspective\r\n- Monotone throughout, practice tone variation and volume variation\r\n- Good segue into burden "that's why" -- could use tone variation to indicate transition to another part of your opening (drop to a more casual, matter-of-fact tone for describing burden)\r\n- Good job laying out what you will prove, but you need to simplify this language a lot more. Anybody listening will get lost because the explanation of what you have to prove is so convoluted\r\n- Good layout of what witnesses will tell the jury\r\n- Your theme is not clear at all in this statement; I have no idea what it is. Is it the metaphor you repeat at the beginning and end?\r\n- Ending is too dramatic and uses flowery language. Try to be more matter-of-fact and down-to-earth so you can relate to the jury better	8	- Good emotion right out of the gate, but for defense opening especially, you want to be more down-to-earth and less emotional/intense\r\n- Great jumping into story of what happened immediately\r\n- I understand your theory immediately--that it was Cameron Poole, and Bowman is taking the blame. Good job.\r\n- Good use of clear terms that make your theory easy to understand like "scapegoat"\r\n- Transition into burden pocket was not distinct enough--tone variety can help jury hear big transitions in your statement\r\n- Good description of what witnesses will testify to, but I'm confused about the significance of the testimony, and you talk about each witness for too long. Needs to be a condensed/concise description of the most important parts of witnesses' testimony\r\n- No tone variation throughout this statement. Need to practice dropping in volume, using a different emotion to fuel tone, going at a faster or slower pace at certain parts\r\n- Need to spend more time humanizing the defendant\r\n- Theme is not said enough and is not clear enough. I think it's too long.	7	5	8	7	- Good background and costume\r\n- Good visual aid\r\n- Speak more slowly, it's good to be emphatic and animated but don't sacrifice an easy-to-understand pace\r\n- Good emotion but perhaps slightly overdone; try to imagine what a witness actually trying to keep it together on the stand would act like\r\n- Answer the question you are asked. In redirect, your answers are narrative.\r\n- Do not speak during objection arguments; as a witness, you are technically not supposed to be hearing the objection in the first place, and you need to let your attorney handle this.	- Do not pretend you didn't hear the attorney--you pretended to get emotional at the beginning of cross and then acted like you couldn't hear the first question, this is not a good move. \r\n- This impeachment looks terrible for you. The "white lie" response makes things even worse. If there are bad facts in your affidavit, find a way to laugh them off or gloss over them in your response to lessen the blow, don't get yourself impeached\r\n- Answer the questions you are asked. You are too fighty on cross. If the attorney had objected nonresponsive, there are times where I would have sustained.	- Could sound a little more interested as you ask questions, like you're genuinely interested in hearing the answer\r\n- Good pace of questions/answers\r\n- Use simpler language: "demonstrative you generated" you could just say "graph you made"\r\n- Questions you ask during visual aid do not match up with visual aid, or it is unclear\r\n- Your objection responses are good but need to be much shorter\r\n- "I'm so sorry that happened to you" is delivered emotionless and immediately after witness's response, it's unrealistic\r\n- Bad argumentative objection--The question was not argumenative. This objection, and other form objections, are a last resort. Save these for when the question is really poorly asked and deserving of a form objection like this. \r\n- Careful about your facial expressions during cross\r\n- Good redirect to allow the witness to rehabilitate herself from the impeachment	- Your initial objections are concise and strong but do not lose confidence on the second level of the argument, always think about what you will say if the judge returns to you for more commentary during an objection battle\r\n- You missed a speculation objection\r\n- Impeachment questions must be close-ended and more pointed. "This is your affidavit?" "This is your signature at the bottom?" "You knew you had to be truthful?" "You knew you had up until the beginning of this trial to make any changes?" "Please read silently as I read aloud."\r\n- The impeachment worked because the witness messed up, not because this impeachment was performed well. The impeachment was very messy, the right questions were not asked, and you let the witness get away with talking a lot. That's okay--all of this is fixable! Ask more pointed questions, talk to someone to help you with impeachment procedure.\r\n- When you accidentally interrupt the witness, remain composed. Just say "Excuse me--did you have a chance to finish your answer?" or something like that instead of apologizing and becoming flustered\r\n- Witness control sounds too harsh. Try to have a less intense tone.\r\n- Good job bringing out what the witness doesn't know\r\n- Good attempts at witness control, directing the witness back to your question, but as the witness continues to ramble, make sure you tag the ends of your questions with "yes or no" or just ask "was that a yes?" especially when it's important the jury hears a clear answer for a particularly vital question\r\n- Line of questioning does a great job casting doubt on Bowman's involvement and establishing Poole's involvement	6	5	6	7	- If testimony is stricken do not try to bring it up again; go with your attorney, try to work around it\r\n- Some answers are too long/narrative. Try to tighten answers to only respond to the question asked. \r\n- Emotionless delivery of what happened to the officer\r\n- Eye contact needs to be better	- This impeachment looks bad for you.\r\n- Do not contradict your affidavit simply because the facts are damning for you. Find a better workaround. \r\n- Good job not fighting on every question, but when you do say yes, try to be less hesitant about it otherwise it's like you're saying yes but you wish you didn't have to	- Good job rephrasing after sustained objection\r\n- Be confident in your objection responses! No "I believe"\r\n- Do not say you don't have a response--think through the objection, was there any out-of-court statement? Is it being offered for the truth? If so, does it fall under a hearsay exception? You can ask for a moment if you need, but do not say you don't have a response\r\n- If testimony is stricken do not try to bring it up again--must adapt to sustained objections\r\n- You weren't scored on this but I would advise that you do not thank the judge or the witness (unless it's the end of your direct with the witness); it makes me think you're about to end the direct only for you to then continue\r\n- Good signposting transitions to different portions of direct\r\n- After an objection that you win you need to re-ask your question to let the witness finish their answer if they didn't get the chance to\r\n- Your confidence increased later on during objection battles, good work!\r\n- Good attempt at redirect addressing impeachment but the point didn't land\r\n- Redirect is too long--needs to be to-the-point and address what happened in cross examination	- Good job consistently asking to be heard instead of making a speaking objection, per my prior comment\r\n- Good speculation objection; well argued on all levels\r\n- Good job asking for a limiting instruction and being familiar enough with hearsay to understand opposing counsel was arguing subsequent action\r\n- Do not overobject--you won several objections, including the ones you re-raised, which is great. Quit while you're ahead unless there's a truly imperative objection later on.\r\n- Speak slowly in objection arguments--you aren't being timed, make sure you are slow and clear\r\n- Good job incriminating Poole in line of questioning\r\n- Start the cross with a better intro than "I do have a few questions for you." Give a header so I know what you'll be talking about.\r\n- Good attempts at witness control but don't give up or let the witness take control. For example, do not accept "I think so" as a response. If the witness is not giving a yes, make them.\r\n- Verbal pauses/hesitation in asking questions slows down the pace of your cross. You want to build a rhythm/pace that makes it seem like you are in control.\r\n- Do not ask a question then ask another question before the witness answers\r\n- Try not to interrupt the witness, I know this is hard on Zoom, but do your best\r\n- Impeachment procedure is messy. You did not ask the correct foundational objections. Refer to my prior comments for the other impeachment for more guidance on this. The impeachment landed, but because the witness messed up, not because the impeachment was conducted well. \r\n- Do not interrupt the witness as often as you do. It's okay to respectfully interject but do not talk over her aggressively. \r\n- How many questions is this cross? It feels too long. Crosses need to be concise and to-the-point\r\n- "Did you see Cameron Poole taking money?" \r\n- "Did you see the wrist bands?"\r\n- The above are open-ended questions, ask leading questions on cross instead.\r\n- Good job incriminating Poole in line of questioning	4	6	4	9	- You ran out of time in a way that severely impacted the performance of this direct; I really wish your team had left you enough time so that we could see what this direct would have looked like.	- You fight way too much on cross. You don't have to fight on everything. Say yes when you can, it helps you look less biased, especially as an expert\r\n- Do not ask what the question was. It makes it seem like you were not listening because you gave such a nonresponsive answer.	- Talk to your team about leaving you enough time for direct, you were egregiously over time and your timekeeper seemed to be making up a random time you had left when asked\r\n- Good tone for the time you had\r\n- Be very careful of your expressions during cross. I could see you laughing.	- Super bold to try a voir dire! I have done several voir dires, and I think you made a good objection, but voir dires must be very short (like under ten questions). I appreciate the courage, but I would not argue that the detective has never worked with robberies when it clearly says she has in the supplemental report. If you want to try this again in the future, my advice would be to voir dire only on grounds you know you can prove and to make it VERY short and snappy--as few questions as possible\r\n- Good improper opinion objection\r\n- Great witness control with simple "is that a yes to my question?"\r\n- You have great courtroom demeanor as a baseline. Try adding tone, volume, and pace variation to upgrade your performance\r\n- You can move to different parts of the screen when you move onto a different pocket of your cross to visually indicate to the jury that you are moving onto a different point.\r\n- Great job bringing out bias on this detective\r\n- Good headers to pockets to indicate when moving onto another point\r\n- Good witness control throughout\r\n-  Great job bringing out insufficient investigation on State's part. The substance of this cross is great, work on making delivery engaging\r\n- Your tone should change between pockets so that the jury can hear that you are moving onto a different point; overall, you can make your cross easy to follow by giving more subtle indicators of when you are transitioning to a different idea\r\n- I like that all your team's crosses ended by incriminating Poole, this consistency is good and makes your theory clear	8	6	8	7	- Good job looking at the photo of the control panel and taking a second to identify it as a real person would; adds realism\r\n- Answers need to be much shorter\r\n- Nice attention to detail with the background	- Try to fight less, you don't need to fight on everything	- Good inquisitive tone\r\n- Clear questions make it easy to follow testimony, good work\r\n- Don't thank the witness in the middle of their testimony, it's unnecessary extra words and confusing\r\n- Don't use "Ms. Isaacs" as a verbal pause, just pause\r\n- Good job adjusting after a sustained objection\r\n- When the crossing attorney is talking over your witness to the extent that Ms. Xing was, you should say something like "point of order--may Ms. Isaacs be allowed to finish her answer?"	- Good speculation objection\r\n- Great lack of foundation, your objections are so much better when they are more concise, great job\r\n- Try to use more human-sounding witness control. "Excuse me, I just need a yes or a no" if you have to interrupt the witness is better\r\n- Good, clear line of questioning\r\n- Your witness control is harsh. Do not talk over the witness, direct them back to your question, ask shorter questions, ask "was that a yes?" to get the witness to cooperate\r\n- Do not say things like "Yes. Exactly." during the witness's response.	8	7	8	8	- Good, clear testimony\r\n- Some answers are way too long, answer the question you were asked	- Fighting too much	- Good job keeping track of which exhibits have been admitted and which ones need to be shown outside view of jury\r\n- Very bizarre and out of place to ask the witness if you can ask about something and then to have them say they can't. You, as the attorney, would have enough information to know what the witness can and cannot testify to. \r\n- Relevance is not a very strong objection, should really only be used when you cannot fathom an explanation for how the question elicits relevant evidence	- Don't ask if you can ask the witness some questions. Just do it.\r\n- Work on better witness control, look at my comments for your co-counsel for more specific guidance	7	8	8	8	- Good emotion grabs attention, try to speak a little slower\r\n- Good job sounding panicked for the intense parts of this story\r\n- Sounds this way for too long, needs variation, needs build up into panicked tone. It gets to be too much.\r\n- You do not need to talk about how unfair it is; seems defensive and doesn't add anything substantively to the evidence that supports your side	- Some fights are smart, but you're fighting too much\r\n- Good job with consistent character on direct and cross	- Good tone for direct\r\n- Sounds naturally inquisitive\r\n- Good job reminding jury of prior testimony to contextualize next question\r\n- Good job confronting defendant with accusation and letting her speak\r\n- Needs tone variation and better signposting\r\n- Retain confidence on objection battles, speak slower to think through what you want to say, excellent argument though	- Good looping\r\n- Avoid compound questions (these questions often use "and"); one thing at a time\r\n- Good job implying Poole and Bowman worked together\r\n- Good short questions like "It was Cameron Pool, correct?" -- short questions help control the witness because they feel silly/look sillier for giving long answers\r\n- Good procedure for admitting exhibit\r\n- 801(d)(2)(e) is statement by party opponent's co-conspirator, familiarize yourself with hearsay rules, but good work so far\r\n- You admit the exhibit, display it for a while, and aren't asking questions about the text messages you have displayed. Confusing.\r\n- Ask tighter questions so that the witness cannot wiggle out/say no	8	- Simplify the language of the burden\r\n- You speak clearly but you are speaking too fast\r\n- Tone, pace, and volume are the same throughout. Try varying it up.\r\n- Good job pointing out why defense's argument is not reasonable\r\n- Good job breaking down the act of pulling the lever to make it seem not reasonable that it was an accident\r\n- Still don't like your theme, in the future themes should be less metaphorical and less flowery	9	- Good volume at the beginning, good statement of theme\r\n- Good job dropping to lower volume afterward, sounding more down-to-earth\r\nGood job starting with your story of what happened\r\n- Good job slowing down at some parts where clarity is extremely important\r\n- Story goes on for too long, start arguing why they haven't met their burden\r\n- Could move to different portions of screen to signpost different sections of closing (for example when you move to burden)\r\n- Good explanation of reasonable doubt\r\n- Good asking questions to poke holes in Prosecution's story\r\n- Closing needs better structure; difficult to follow at times\r\n- Not enough discussion of evidence that incriminates Cameron Poole, which is a huge part of your theory to my understanding	55	119	12	11	13	212	9	8	10	216	t
34	6	Nice job of focusing on why it happened on August 30.   It might be easier to tell the story by telling us what Poole did and to explain that your job is to show that Poole did not act alone.     The "character relationship" visual aid is an interesting idea, but it has so many details that it is quite confusing.    Not sure you are telling us how Winston Thomas's injury is related to the robbery.	8	Nice job of focusing our attention on the detective's potential bias and also very solid job of introducing us to the defendant.  \r\n\r\nExcellent job of delivering the speech at a measured pace that lets you use the full range of your voice to emphasize key points.\r\n\r\nYour questions seem to blend the theft by deception charges and the robbery charges.  You need some sort of structure/transitions to separate out the various issues.  This jumping from charge to charge happens at a number of different points in the speech.  \r\n\r\nAfter your preview of Hunter's testimony,  I still have no clue what we are going to learn from this witness.\r\n\r\nHow does "wrong place, wrong time" apply to the theft by deception charge?  I	6	7	6	7	Bowman got you fired by lying    Isn't that an interesting fact that would frame your telling of the story.\r\n\r\nNot sure that it makes sense for you to be talking about the knife since we have yet to learn how it figures into the charges.\r\n\r\nThere are more powerful ways of organizing the testimony.  A strict chronological order really isn't all that dramatic.	Good job of paying attention to the error regarding the control panel.\r\n\r\nNice job of fighting back without being obvious	The direct would probably be more powerful if it worked back from the injury to Thomas and having the witness explain how it is that Bowman was the one controlling the ride.\r\n\r\nThe witness's answers are too long.  It is easier to follow when the witness gives short answers (one fact for each question) and you have short questions followed by short answers.  \r\n\r\nThe discussion of the employee access door would be easier to follow if you made use of the map.\r\nYou should not be asking questions of opposing counsel   Wait for the judge to talk to the other attorney.	Nice job of making it clear that it is possible to make a mistake with the controls.\r\n\r\nThe pocket of the cross dealing with Chuggie's needs a transition and something that helps us understand why you are moving onto a new topic and what we are going to be learning.   \r\n\r\nMaybe something as "You think you saw Poole again"  Saw Poole at your new job?	7	7	7	6	How Floyd more or less proves that the wristband scheme is more confusing than it needs to be.\r\n\r\n     The account of the robbery at the ticket booth could be delivered more dramatically.\r\n\r\n      It is possible that what Floyd told you is an excited utterance, but you probably need to incorporate some foundational facts to sell that part of the story.	Nice job of fighting on vague, confusing questions.  Fine job of carefully listening to the attorney's questions.	We aren't given a real reason to pay attention to the discussion of the wristbands  It might be more interesting to starting with the loss of money and then get to the details of how the wristbands work.  Remember, a direct is about telling an interesting story.\r\n\r\nThis witness should not be allowed to testify to what they learned from Kimball  Y	The "Poole was stealing my money" should have been objected to.  \r\n\r\nWhat Kimball tells the witness is clearly hearsay and deserves an objection.\r\n\r\nCould do more to draw attention to the curious fact that someone is losing money but doesn't want an official investigation.\r\n\r\nYour questions about meeting with Floyd are much too long and their length gives the witness room to act confused.	5	5	5	8	Could show more emotion when discussing Winnie\r\n\r\nIt isn't clear you were chasing Poole and the direct is quite light as to why you arrested Bowman\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a factual level, the direct does far tool little to connect Bowman to Poole's crimes  \r\nAnd that fact is made quite clear when you are being cross examined.		It is not clear what we are supposed to get from Exhibit 7.  You show us some numbers and move on.\r\n\r\nNor is it made clear what we should learn from Exhibit 9.\r\n\r\n"Would you please elaborate on the robbery on August 30?" is a question that clearly calls for a narrative answer.  And should have drawn an objection.\r\n\r\nThis is a very disjointed direct...it would be easier if you thought about clearly separating the   two crimes   And maybe starting with the most exciting part of the story--the chase to the ToT\r\n\r\nA lot of exhibits are entered, but there is little discussion of them.  The evidence does not speak for itself.  You have to think about a direct as helping your witness tell an interesting story that makes key facts stick out.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the direct needs to be tightened up.  As it is, it often seems like a set of rather random questions.	Decent job of developing the way in which the witness's relationship with Thomas may have influenced the course of the investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen you are crossing, you need to think about making more use of your voice to keep us interested.  Might work on varying pitch and volume to underscore when the questions really matter.	7	7	7	5	Need to be more emotional, more outraged at being accused of a crime that you did not commit.\r\n\r\nCould express more emotion when you are discussing your regrets regarding Poole\r\n\r\nThe explanation as to why you are at the ToT is incomplete and not very convincing. \r\n\r\nCould do more to express your fear at being in the middle of an "active shooter" incident.  Sell us on you being confused, panic-stricken.		The jury sort of expects the denial to come out near the start of the testimony and certainly before we get into details about their work history.\r\nAnd "why are you in court today" is not really a question that one needs to ask of the defendant.  \r\n  The structure of the direct is not as compelling as it could be.  We need the denial and reasons to believe the defendant.  \r\n    It seems like you are leaving a fair number of bad facts that should be exploited on cross.  Might be better to take the sting out those facts by discussing them on direct.	Why jump from the ToT to the wristband scheme so abruptly?   It is not like you fully discussed what happened at the Tunnel of Terror or how Poole was there twice (to let Poole in and let Poole out).\r\n\r\nAnd then you jump back to August 30.  \r\n\r\nCould be more effective in using the text message.	8	7	7	5	Great character...interesting and credible	Nice move on the "I have practiced a lot of times"	I am not sure that the direct makes the key facts that you want us to know about the ride very memorable.  We are really only hearing those facts once and you aren't doing much to reinforce their import.	The map is quite useful for showing us where the exit is and its connection to the Tunnel of Terror.\r\n\r\nNot real sure why you are asking this witness about the bracelets in the dumpster  How does that help your case?\r\n\r\nWhy are you drawing attention to Longstreet's invoices since those weren't discussed on the direct?   These questions have little to do with why seems to be happening in this trial.	8	7	7	5	Great character...appropriately boring for an accountant\r\n\r\nCould work on injecting more vocal variety into your performance....your discussion of the attack sounds far too much like your discussion of the bracelets.	Nice job of fighting on the attorney where she is asking you to "speculate" on Bowman's involvement	From a dramatic standpoint, this would be a more interesting story if you worked your way back from the attack...grab our attention	You need to be using the witness to connect Bowman to Poole's crimes...many of your questions are doing more\r\n\r\nYou need to do more with the knife being linked to Bowman	8	Why in the world are you discussing Haley Floyd at the start..it certainly takes you a long time to get to the robbery.  You would have a better speech if you skipped the material prior to Floyd with a knife at his neck.\r\n\r\nThe story needs to be simplified.  One part of the story is not in dispute...Poole commited some crimes.  What is at issue is whether Bowman was on Poole's team...were they teammates?   \r\n\r\nYou can be more direct in using Bowman's own words to establish that Bowman knew about the wristband scheme (and might have brought out the fingerprints) and did nothing to stop the crime.  And one could argue let Poole in the park to cover up Bowman's involvement.   Why did Bowman help Poole get in through the back door.\r\n\r\nWhere do you get the claim that Bowman had a duty to report the crime?  I think you need to point to the law for that claim.\r\n\r\nYou are sort of skipping over how much effort Bowman put into making sure that she was in the ToT at the very time that Poole was leaving the park.  \r\n\r\nMight be telling us what "blackout mode" would have been like for  Officer Thomas\r\n\r\nWell delivered speech\r\n\r\nREBUTTAL:  It is best to focus on one issue.   Bowman became a suspect because Bowman lied to get into the the ToT and lied to Bowman after the incident.  The big issue that was open to you is the fact that we have learned Bowman does not tell the truth.	9	Fine job of bringing the appropriate amount of passion to the close, especially at the start.  \r\n\r\nI think you probably have to explain why Whitney lied to Issacs to take over the ride   Why was she in that place at that time?   That is a damning fact that the prosecution has that requires some discussion from your side.\r\n\r\nSince the bias claim is something that serves to frame the whole of the prosecution's case, it might make more sense to have that as the first big topic of your closing rather than the discussion of Bowman's relationship with Poole.\r\n\r\nYou can't mention the possible prison time that the defendant will face	17	97	136	138	137	71	139	140	141	68	t
41	7	Absence of light is not absence of justice. \r\nBowman initiated blackout, covered the light- covered the guilt- I like this theme and the imagery you have with it. \r\nI think you can have more storytelling within this opening- there's a lot of details of what is happening, and a lot of names involved, but why should I charge the defendant- why are they specifically guilty? Here you can play more into your theme, as well as vocal inflections to really get your point across!\r\nFloyd- accountant, was there when Poole robbed the booth. \r\nLongstreet- owner, defendant reccomended Poole, let Poole escape. \r\nKimball- detective from MPD, inconsistencies in defendant statement deceiving police- but isn't this person a police officer? \r\nI'm not sure the use of the charges/demo here in the opening is effective- the visual doesn't necessarily add much to the opening, instead it can be distracting from the speech.	8	I like how the opening humanizes the defendant- very good here. \r\nNo awareness of stolen cash, no intentional actions, no knowledge of robbery- this is a high claim you're taking upon yourself, but if you can pull it off its very good. \r\nHunter- previous employee, Bowman is friendly and rule abiding. \r\nBowman- was working all day, no knowledge of robbery. \r\nKaminsky- limo driver, only Poole was the one with the profits. \r\nI think the order of your witnesses is interesting- why call the defendant in the middle? If them being party witness is a problem, call them first to make sure that they're out of the way, if  it's an asset, then call them last.	8	9	8	6	"Get of my ass and explore new places" very memorable indeed.	Your witness seemed chatty, but you were also chatty on direct so it worked out for you.	You can take more time inbetween the witness answer and your question, to make it look less scripted. \r\nNice response to the hearsay objection, although you might have overstepped a little by saying that producing these kinds of demonstratives were under a regularly conducted activity. \r\nHow much of this business with the scamming tickets involves the defendant and the actual charges? You might get a relevance objection on some of these questions.  \r\nRelevance obj on whether this witness wants to believe the defendant is guilty?	Stick to your guns! Or if you're going to make an objection, have a strong argument for why I should be siding with you. (on the 801 objection). You did a good job of this on the second objection, but I'm not sure your argument was a counter to 803(2). \r\nPlease do not end all of your questions with "correct". \r\nDon't cut off the witness! Even if their answer is too long (which happens a lot) let them finish their answer. \r\nI liked your later questions about the knife and whether it could have been stolen.	7	8	7	8	"Amusement park for the poor"	"I fired him on Friday so he wasn't here on Friday" good answer. \r\nGood job sticking to your guns about not being there.	When asking the witness to identify the defendant, make sure to note that the record is noted that the witness has correctly identified the defendant, and also that the defendant has their camera on bc otherwise it seems a bit weird as to how they recognized them. \r\nHow does the witness know everything that happened the day of the robbery? I might have missed this, but is this call coming through Kimball, in which case it might be hearsay?	"Why do you think there's a change" spec objection? 701? \r\nKeep your questions with yes/no answers, because otherwise there's the possibility that the witness just chatters on. \r\nGood Q about the no background check on Poole. \r\nGood Q's about not seeing Bowman. \r\nAlso, do not end all of your questions with "correct" or "right".	8	9	8	7	200 embezzlement cases, financial detective.\r\nGood cadence and tones, seem very reliable as an expert. \r\n4 inconsistencies! Ok but are inconsistencies grounds for conviction? I'm not sure this direct takes that next step.	You are definitely not a ride operator but I'm not sure the rules have changed, considering that you did previously agree that it was allowed as long as you got permission.	Bowman supplied the knife- how does this witness know this! 602 obj right here. \r\nIn general terms, I think if you're going to have this witness say all of these things, you need to explain the process of the investigation before they testify all of these things they found, to avoid foundation issues. \r\nExhibit 5- admitted. \r\nGood back and forth on the 703!	The hearsay objection, while not the correct objection- was good in terms of what they were saying- if you were to object based on speculation or lack of foundation I probably would have agreed with you.\r\nThat was a good hearsay objection on the Isaacs statements, however their response was not a hearsay response, but a 703 response, so just make sure that your response is tailored to their argument!\r\nA little trigger happy on objections but I think you had the right idea on most of them, just needed to get the rule number down. \r\nGood bias box, "determined to hold someone accountable" \r\nDo NOT let the witness explain! You are in charge, if they need to explain they can do so on re-direct. \r\nGreat knife box, this witness never saw this knife.	8	6	7	9	The panic and overall chaos of the scene is very believable- however I'm not sure you ever established how you got from the Mind Eraser to the Tunnel of Terror.	Good early start, but towards the end be ready to fight more on some of those really crucial points- I think you fought too much on some points that didn't really matter and not enough on the big ones.	Good questions, good overall flow. \r\nGood job pulling the sting on some of how their could be inconsistencies with the detective.	Good box about how Bowman never reported the theft of the cash from the fake wristbands. \r\nOverall good on the box with the burner phone, but you could have gone further with the fact that Poole is the only contact and that there were messages sent on that day- especially since you have the exhibit admitted, and can read the texts. \r\nAlways have the affidavit ready to go! Saves you a lot of time and just looks smoother in the case you have to impeach. \r\nVery good last couple of questions, but you can connect it to the charges! He opened the door, and then Poole ran out, escaping with the money, etc.	7	7	7	9	I think you could stand to break up some of your answers more, they tend to be quite long- aim for 3-4 sentences per answer!	Generally good on cross, just make sure to watch in some places you're digging yourself too deep- if there are bad facts just own them, don't try to overexplain them.	Exhibit 4 admitted- employee manual \r\nThis is a very short direct- is there nothing further you can get out from this witness about Longstreet being shady that would help your defendant?	Never made a mistake operating ToT- this could be a good opportunity to show a demo to really get it through how hard it would be to make a mistake. \r\nGood bias box relating to this witness wanting to get something scandalous. \r\nGood catch on the yelling vs pushing.	7	8	7	9	I thought your direct was solid, you seemed very stable and reliable.	I would agree with you that customers do not know what rides operators are assigned, good answer. \r\nI would also agree with you that you don't have firsthand knowledge of if Poole is the one directly increasing your business, while it might be probable.	Good overall flow and cadence, I would just say you need to emphasize why your points align with your defense- this witness definitely knows Poole is super shady, but how does that make Bowman not guilty? Try to take that extra step to align your facts with the elements. \r\nThe quote by Poole is a good hearsay objection, but I think your argument would have been better if you implemented the fact that the grocery store is a mile away- so it would take some time to get from the park to the store, so it wouldn't necessarily be "immediately after"- if you had said this I would've probably ruled in your favor. \r\nWhy not use the later quotes from the car ride- where the person says that they didn't want to be involved? It seems like if that was Bowman, like the prosecution is trying to make it out to be, that would help you argue that Bowman was not complicit.	You do not need to end all of your questions with "correct" or "is that correct"- you can just ask "he would turn up the speed?" \r\nI think you can push more on some of these aspects of how shady this witness is and how willing they are to do things for cash- like they basically acted as the getaway driver for a crime, no questions asked and were willing to pick up an unknown for cash- this witness should be made out to be incredibly suspicious!	8	Your speech was very clear and well-spoken overall, but I think it needed to be more responsive to the trial. \r\nI'm not sure I heard anything about tax evasion? The defense main case to be seemed to be more about Poole acting alone than Longstreet committing tax evasion.\r\nYour argument on individual points was good, but I think you need more overall structure- have you strong individual points build up into your cohesive arguments that show each element of the burden.	7	Good points that there is not strong evidence connecting Bowman to Poole, especially on the knife point. \r\nSaying that Bowman looking over Poole stealing money was just a favor for a friend is probably more than a bit of a stretch, especially when you are arguing so strongly about how Bowman was someone who argued for justice.	24	117	215	212	213	126	216	220	124	217	t
79	9	Great pace and natural tone.\r\nI like your lying theme\r\n"She knew, she planned, she lied."\r\nVery believable helpful structure. Great return to theme.\r\nI like the fact that you are standing in front of a white background.	7	Sounds like you're reading from a script.\r\nGood job humanizing your client and identifying the motivations of all the different players.	8	7	9	8	Lots of personality.\r\nMaterialistic rich girl.\r\nGood character arc from funny overview of facts to serious approach to robbery.	No complaints but nothing spectacular here.	Very professional.\r\nNo criticisms on the direct, but there also wasn't anything spectacular about it.\r\nGreat objections improved your score.	Great use of her "chanel bag" testimony.\r\nYou could have tied the "chanel bag" question better to relevance, it's impeachment evidence. She runs the park but says she can't afford a purse? It goes to her credibility.\r\nI like your logical approach, but try breaking down your questions into short yes or no leading questions.\r\nIf she doesn't answer your question, reask it, but even shorter.\r\n\r\nStick to the facts and away from opinions.	8	7	7	6	Good commanding presence.\r\nCould use more character.	No complaints but nothing spectacular here.	This opinion testimony is highly suspect.\r\nOverall this witness should be more factual.\r\n\r\nGood tone, structure, and presence but legally, this isn't right.	Too conclusory and open-ended.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the spirit!	9	8	9	6	What accent is this? American Southern it seems\r\nFunny	Impossible to score you down or up, you only got 2 questions.	Good response to objection.\r\nGood commanding presence.	Fearless objections.\r\nQuestions are too open ended.\r\nAsk more questions!	7	6	7	9	Good character, actually believable\r\nCould do more funny stuff	Ugh oh, don't fight with the prosecutor! Stay in character.	Try to listen to what the objecting attorney is saying and respond to the objection they're making. Sometimes you justified your witnesses testimony well but didn't respond to their stated objection.\r\nLots of hearsay in this testimony.\r\n\r\nGood persistence.	Good hearsay objection\r\nGood bolstering objection but you have made her honesty a relevant part of the case, so defense is allowed to offer character evidence of a relevant character trait\r\nGood objections\r\n\r\nGood impeachment.\r\nToo long! Could have gotten a 10.	7	8	7	9	It's good for a witness to know the rules of evidence too so you know not to testify to things that are objectionable.	Don't fight.	Make sure to keep your questions to facts for a non-expert opinion witness.\r\nGood persistence.	Good objections.\r\nGood use of leading questions.\r\n\r\nGood short cross, that gets an extra point from me.	7	6	7	7	Believable but arguing against a lot of people!\r\nTry to come off as more neutral, even though you're the defendant. Stick the facts.	Fighting way too much.	When a question is objected to, re-ask it.\r\nA lot of this isn't relevant to the charges. Especially the emotional attack on JC Longstreet.	Good objections, but a little over-eager.\r\nGood impeachments.\r\nGreat opening section to your cross.\r\n\r\nDon't fight the witness too much. Kill them with paper cuts.\r\nToo long.\r\n\r\nStarted at a 9 and went down to 7 cause the cross was way too long.	9	A bit too intense.\r\n\r\nGood return to theme.\r\nGood use of physical space.\r\nVery smooth transitions between the different sections of your speech.\r\n\r\nThe bottle metaphor doesn't really work for the prosecution, I think.\r\nDisbelieving Bowman does not equal finding her guilty of robbery.	9	Glad you're immediately responding to their theme, it's a great way to start and it shows you're willing to take a risk in this speaking competition.\r\n\r\nGreat impassioned defense.\r\nGood job humanizing your client.	25	125	145	142	144	222	147	143	146	224	t

This was a tough witness and you kept him on his toes.	7	6	8	8	I like the character, but you need to be prepared for that 702 as it pertains to robbery.	You need to give us more character on cross.	Really great job defending the objections.  My only advice would be to slow down.  You have a tendency to speed up when answering objections and it could be hard for the judge to follow.	You have an excellent grasp of the evidence code.  Nice job.	9	8	8	8	Really great witness.  Best character yet.  Very believable.	Try and keep the character you have on direct during cross.	Good direct.  Very natural.  I'd maybe work on adjusting the angle of your camera.	Solid cross.  Tough witness to deal with.	8	7	7	6	Very believable witness.  You showed the correct amount of contrition and I could follow the story very well.	You don't need the accent.  However, if you do use it, make sure it's consistent throughout.	Your direct was fine.  Tough with the facts of this witness.	Your questions are good but not reactive to what the witness is saying.  Take into account what they say and use that in your questions.	8	7	8	6	Fun witness but not as believable.	Would go better if you kept up the character and gave us more thorough answers instead of trying to stall the time.

I would suggest using headphones next time for better audio quality (No points deducted, just a friendly suggestion:))	7	I didn't quite get the rose metaphor	8	7	8	6	I love your costume! I would prefer a little less scripted. At this point it did sound a little like reciting but I'm sure it will get better as the rounds go on. Good job!	I think you held onto your points really well but I would suggest not to appear reluctant to admit something that your attorney won't be able to help you on (ex. she looks as if she is going to cry, is that right? just say yes and get it over with... no one is going to remember it)	Well done, good logic flow and well argued objections.	Listen to the judge carefully and try to understand what the judge is trying to ask.	10	10	8	7	Great character, well done:)	Well done holding on to your point while staying professional.	I don't quite understand how is the financial report part comes in... Also no need to be super aggressive when arguing the objection. After an objection is over, if your question was part of a line of reasoning, restate the whole line in the question because they jury probably lost you after that line got interrupted.	Well argued objections, but no need to be so aggressive. Slow down and its okay:)	8	8	8	7	Great character. Loved the metaphors. But also make sure not to spend too much time on irrelevant details.	Held on to the character.	Well argued objections	The logic is a little bit messy.	8	7	7	7	Good flow	I am not entirely sure why you sound offended in the end. Stay in character.		That's not exactly the definition of an improper opinion.	8	8	7	9	Some of the reasonings sounded a little forced	That's kind of a weird way for getting out of an accusation for lying...

84	6	- Theme: This case is about deception and desperation. \r\n- Narrative: checked. To improve, I think you can directly go and tell your story. Never let members of the jury imagine something. \r\n- Two criminal accounts: Did the defendant commit a guilty of theft by colluded deception? - I am confused at this point. I don't think you have clearly explained and defined the two criminal \r\n- The burden of proof: beyond a reasonable doubt. However, you have not defined your burden of proof. What exactly is "beyond a reasonable doubt? "\r\n- Two questions: did the defendant commit a guilty of theft by colluded deception? / Is the defendant an accessory to the robbery? \r\n- Witness introduction: checked. \r\n\r\n- Good to repeat your team's theme.\r\n- Good use of your demonstrative. \r\n- Good flow. You can add more pauses and changes in tone.	8	- Theme: Is Cameron Poole, not Whit Bowman. \r\n- Narrative: checked. \r\n- Charge: Robbery Case I and theft by deception. \r\n- The prosecution needs to prove: purposefully, knowingly, recklessly - explained clearly. \r\n- Beyond a reasonable doubt. Briefly defined and explained. \r\n- Facts: Bowan has no motive - work hard / Bowan has not participated in the plan or the action - the Internet connection is unstable - witness intro checked.  / Bowan wants to save lives.\r\n\r\n- I think you can consider using a demonstrative to make your opening even clearer. (and jut in case unstable Internet connection)\r\n- Good to repeat your team's theme\r\n- Good pause and tone. Generally good flow.	7	7	7	5	You are really professional. I think you can build an even stronger character. Professional character is boring for a lay witness. For example, you can consider building a businesswoman who cares about gender inequality very much. \r\n\r\nGood pauses in your response, but your answers do not sound natural - you are reciting or reading your script. I think you can improvise more in your responses.\r\n\r\nGood facial expression and hand gestures.	I think you are a little bit too aggressive in your cross. \r\n\r\nActually, I like your facial expressions. Those make your character more interesting. \r\n\r\nGood short and firm responses when the attorney is challenging your reliability.\r\n\r\nWhen responding to the attorney's questions, you could try to explain more instead of just giving short answers.\r\n\r\nWhen you are being impeached, you can try to explain more after the attorney finishes reading your affidavit. You can improvise to make your statement logical.	Objection:\r\n- I think your response to the objection "relevance" at the end of your direct examination is well-structured. \r\n- Hearsay: good mention of the definition. Check Rule 801(a), the definition of "Statement." A statement must be an oral assertion. Here, you could try to object on the ground of "Speculation" (speculating other people's state of mind). \r\n- When the opposing attorney is referring to the affidavit, you can object to "hearsay". Reading any words from affidavits is a hearsay statement unless the attorney is impeaching your witness. Clearly, he is not in today's circumstances. \r\n\r\nGood structure of the direct. \r\n\r\nGood content coverage. \r\n\r\nI think you can add more transition words. You have already added some, but you need to emphasize those.	Objection: \r\n- Remember to make timely objections. \r\n- Improper evidence: I understand that defending Bowan's good character is probably essential to your team's case theory, but you do not need to refuse any negative impressions from entering the court. I think you can let them go in some circumstances (for example, this one). \r\n- Never read directly from the affidavit unless you are impeaching. I think you tried to impeach, but you are not following the proper procedure of impeaching. You can be objected to by hearsay. \r\n\r\nI am not sure that spending so much time challenging the witness's reliability is wise.\r\n\r\nI think you can add more transitions to your script. \r\n\r\nAsk your questions clearly - do not let your witness ask you to repeat your questions over and over.\r\n\r\nYou sent too much time on your cross. Be aware of the time management.	6	6	4	8	Like you showing your visiting card when introducing yourself. This makes you very professional and reliable.\r\n\r\nI heard you answer "Yes, sir," which is compliant with your job as a detective. Good. \r\n\r\nI think the objection battles have severely influenced my judging of your performance. To avoid this, you and your attorney really need to work on your scripts, avoiding having any potential objections. \r\n\r\nI think you are reading scripts from your computer, avoid doing it in the next round.	I think you can extend your character in your cross. For example, instead of answering "yes," you can answer "yes, ma'am," firmly and shortly.\r\n\r\nYou can try to explain more in your responses. Remember, you are the expert, and you are the one with the expertise. \r\n\r\nIn the series of questions "You never considered....," I think you could explain more. After all, this information directly influences the reliability of your conclusions.	Objection: \r\n- If you want your witness to make expert conclusions (for example, in your case, you want the witness to conclude based on her investigation), you need to lay the foundations of Rule 702 and directly motion to enter the witness as an expert witness in the field of xxx. \r\n- Although sometimes,  a detective can be considered to be a lay witness, without entering them into expert witnesses. But I think in your case, you need to consider entering Francis Kimball as an expert witness in the field of criminology or something. Once she is entered as an expert witness, she can make conclusions and opinions based on the results of her investigation. \r\n- Hearsay: a witness's statement, even if it is included in the case package, can be considered to be hearsay. Double check Rule 801 and Rule 802 for detailed definitions of hearsay and each component of hearsay. \r\n\r\nI think to need to revise your script. You need to be more clear about the general procedure (including how to enter your witness as an expert witness and enter exhibits into evidence). Being objected to on the ground of "Lack of foundation" multiple times means your script lacks a logical flow.\r\n\r\nDo not cut off your own witness.	Objection: \r\n- Lack of foundation: A person does not need any expertise to make a conclusion. I'm confused by your arguments on whether you need a motion to enter an expert witness. However, I do believe you need a motion, and I believe the procedure is written in the PPMT Handbook.  \r\n- Good objections on "Lack of foundation" and "Improper opinion."\r\n- "Motion to strike" means something is already on the record (i.e., the court has received/heard that information), and you wish not to include them in the future because your objection has been sustained. \r\n\r\nBe cautious of the use of pronouns. The witness prefers to use she/her/her.\r\n\r\nNever say "Thank you" to your honor. Stay professional.\r\n\r\nGood transitions in your cross. \r\nGood control of your witness.\r\nGood structure. Good content coverage.	7	7	7	9	Be consistent when introducing yourself in the first question. If you want to spell your last name, then spell the last names of all your three witnesses. \r\n\r\nI think you also sound really professional. However, hearing three professional witnesses testify in court is very challenging for members of the jury and the judge. I think your team could work on developing more funny and diverse characters.	Good responses on "I am not familiar with him. I am only a colleague of his. "\r\n\r\nI think your responses are relatively good. Instead of merely answering "yes," you also explain your questions.	Objection: \r\n- Rule 702 foundation: a - checked; b - checked; c-checked; d-checked\r\n- Be clear of the procedure of entering exhibits into evidence. \r\n\r\nBe aware of the time. You can improve your time management by practicing more. \r\n\r\nGood structure. Good content coverage.\r\n\r\nYou can add more transitions.	Good structure. Good content coverage. \r\n\r\nGood control of your witness. \r\n\r\nGood flow and good change in tone. \r\n\r\nYour team needs to manage the time more wisely. The first cross-examination took too much time.	9	7	7	8	I think you are trying to build a character, and I think you are generally successful. To enhance your character, I think you could include an accent or improvise some jokes. \r\n\r\nI like the natural flow of the direct. Good pauses in your answers. \r\n\r\nI like your emotion when recalling what happened. You also successfully built your character of being hardworking and a good person. To enhance your character, you can integrate some sayings into your answers to make those characters more reliable.	Good maintenance of your character in the cross, but you tend to lose your character at the end of your cross. \r\n\r\nYou could explain more in some of the questions. For example, in the question "You were concerned? " You can explain what exactly concerned you. \r\n\r\nYou may not speak during the objection battle.\r\n\r\nIn the cross, if you are asked about something you do not have knowledge of, you can simply under "I don't know."	Objection: \r\n - The first series of questions: "Did you hear..." could be objected to on the ground of leading - because, obviously,  the answers are suggested in your question. \r\n - Hearsay when entering the exhibit: You are not using the truth of the matter asserted by the exhibit; you are using it to overturn something the prosecution explains. \r\n\r\nI think the cooperation between you and your witness is very good. The flow of the direct examination is natural.\r\n\r\nGood content coverage. Add more transitions. Emphasize transitions.	Objection: \r\n- Enter exhibits into evidence. You cannot read anything from the exhibit without entering it into evidence.  \r\n\r\nAdd more transitions. Emphasize transitions. Good content coverage. \r\n\r\nGood control of your witness.\r\n\r\nGood use of the exhibit. You took advantage of a Zoom court by zooming in and annotating directly on the exhibit. I think it makes your cross clearer. \r\n\r\nBe aware of your time. You spent too much time on your cross.	7	7	8	7	I am not sure cigarettes are allowed in court.  I understand it helps you to build a character, but it will not help you to build a likable character. I'm okay with that, but other judges may not. \r\n\r\nYour character is not compliant with the cigarettes you are holding. I suggest you not do this the next time.	I think your responses in the cross are natural.\r\n\r\nYour explanations are also timely and appropriate. \r\n\r\nI like your balance between short questions and long explanations.	I think the flow of the direct is natural.\r\n\r\nYou could add more transitions to separate your direct into specific parts. \r\n\r\nThe direct is, generally speaking, engaging. \r\n\r\nGood objections.	Objection: \r\n- Counsel is testifying: You must ask a question. \r\n- Compound questions: You can only ask one question at a time.	8	8	7	6	I like how you introduce your "AAA company." lmao\r\n\r\nI think you are really clever when building your character. I like your reference to your background. I also like how you refer to your QR code and give discounts. \r\n\r\nI think you can be more emotional when giving your testimony. Add more changes in tone.	Good greetings. You enhance your character in the cross-examination. \r\n\r\nThe opposing attorney's unable to connect makes me unable to fairly judge your performance.	You could add more transitions to separate your direct into specific parts. \r\n\r\nI think the flow of the direct is natural.\r\n\r\nGood use of hand gestures, but most of them are not visible. You can make it more obvious.	Huaiyuan Ni covered the cross-examination because Yueyue Ding had some technical issues.	6	"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the jury." - change it to "May it please the court, opposing counsel, members of the jury."\r\n\r\nI think you speak too fast. You should slow down and speak in a more engaging manner. It is a Mock Trial competition, not a debate. \r\n\r\nNarrative: You need to use evidence from today's trial to tell the whole picture of the story. \r\n\r\nThe burden of proof: You need to reiterate your burden of proof. You also need to define and briefly explain it. \r\n\r\nIn today's case, you should focus on proving your criminal charges beyond a reasonable doubt rather than explaining why the defense fails to reach their charges. \r\n\r\nI think the closing can be longer. \r\n\r\nYou need to repeat your team's theme again. \r\n\r\nI think	8	It's deception and desperation. However, how many times has the defendant done it? -- Good breaking the opposing team's theme. \r\n\r\nYour speed of speaking is appropriate. You could add more changes in tone to make your closing more engaging. \r\n\r\nIt is good for you to tell the story, based on the evidence you have, from your side. You could refer back to "quotes" more (i.e., who said who).\r\n   - Good reference to the detective's reliability. \r\n   - Good comparison. \r\n   - Good going over every element. \r\n\r\nCriminal charges: checked. \r\nFacts: Three facts were reviewed.\r\n\r\nGood repeat your team's theme.	27	137	57	236	194	59	60	56	197	199	t
170	6	Simplify the language even more so that the jury can understand. You don't have to get into all the legal jargon in this case. Keep the language about the charge really clear and simple.\r\n\r\nTake more pauses during your statement. You are really passionate and we can tell that. But you are also throwing a lot of information at the jury. Make sure you present them slowly and clearly so that the jury can follow along\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is because of the audio or other tech issues, I didn't hear your theme at the beginning of your opening.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to talk about the $20/$15 in the opening. This is getting too much into the detail. Try to keep the opening to be an overview of the case so that the jury doesn't get overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nTake the slide down, you want the jury to focus on you instead of the slides.	8	This is a case about possibilities\r\n\r\nIt seems that you are reading from a script instead of looking at the camera. \r\n\r\nI love the parallel you did with "the possibility that..."\r\n\r\nYou have great use of hand gestures. But make sure you put them in the little box so that we can see it. We can only see part of your hand gestures.\r\n\r\nONLY FOCUSED ON WHIT BOWMAN --- I love the pacing when you are presenting this line. IT WAS SO GREAT.	8	7	7	7	Yes sir --> Yes Ma'am\r\n\r\nI like the passion you are bringing to the table. Your team made a great choice to call you as the first witness.\r\n\r\nThe question about your educational/work background is a bit too long. Cut it into smaller questions.\r\n\r\nTake a pause before you respond. It	Keep the energy up for the cross. You should try to incorporate an "A-HA" moment in cross.	Good response on 703. Try to write out the objection response.\r\n\r\nI like how you changed your tone toward the end of the direct when you are asking about what happened on the	They are referring to 8038 public record instead of 703. Richard v Mississippi BBQ is for 703 only. But really good summary of what the case law is about \r\n\r\nVery good response to the 8038 public record. This should be your first response. YOU ARE DOING AN AMAZING JOB MAKING ARGUMENTS. Take a second to organize your argument before you start responding. \r\n\r\nWatch the "uhh" in the middle of your response. If the judge asks you a question, give a clear answer. You are thinking really fast. But let's try to take the objection one step at a time. Let the opposing counsel brings out the exception first before you start arguing why the statement doesn't fall under the exception.\r\n\r\nWatch out for what you say when you are not muted. Definitely don't curse in front of the judge lmao.\r\n\r\nLet's just move on to your investigation --> You can come up with a better signpost to signify what you are going to say.	7	5	6	7	Very interesting character moment. Make sure that's something the jury can understand though. Like if you get a judge like me, I can probably understand the joke. But I'm pretty sure judges who didn't grow up in China can't really know what is going on. The moment is also a little forced. But it's a fun one!\r\n\r\nIt seems like you are reading from the script cuz you kept looking at the bottom left of the screen		Counsel is testifying! -- She cannot just say "I'll take it as a yes" "He did remind you of Poole" and directly move on without letting the witness answer the question\r\n\r\nBadgering the witness is the objection you should be raising. The attorney was	The wristband hahahaha\r\n\r\nYou can't just say I believe that's a no, let's continue.\r\n\r\nGood response to speculation.\r\n\r\nDon't cut off the witness. Let her finish before you ask the next question.\r\n\r\nDon't just copy the whole procedure from in person mock trial. It does not translate to online mock trial at all. You should change the procedure accordingly.\r\n\r\nBreak up your questions into smaller ones. It's a little hard to follow along when you get fast.\r\n\r\nThe cross is well written. You obviously have control over the witness. BUT DO NOT CROSS THE LINE by cutting the witness. Stay calm and collected. You were speeding a lot toward the end when she wasn't sure about her testimony	5	5	5	7					7	7	8	7			Don't cut off your witness\r\n\r\nWatch the "and" at the beginning of your response\r\n\r\nGood hearsay response the second time around with 8033. You seem really confident and collected.	Good LOPK to Hearsay objection. Make sure you make the LOPK objection first cuz there was no statement at the beginning. You can say something like "We have on a good faith basis to believe that this is based on a conversation that took place among the employees, and that will be hearsay"\r\n\r\nVERY GOOD SPECULATION OBJECTION.\r\n\r\nIn the future, try to pay attention to what the witness is saying so that you can say "objection your honor hearsay, as to..." (this part of the statement)	7	6	7	7				Really good response to 8032. You were a little confused as to the 8033 response they brought up. Check the ROE to make sure you know the exception they are referring to.	8	7	7	7				Exhibit 3 cannot be entered into evidence under admission by party opponent because Whit Bowman was not the one who made the statement (he's not the declerant).	8		8		50	143	210	206	184	203	207	186	208	209	t
112	4	Good job outlying the details of the case, I was able to follow very easily without reading the case. Your speaking style tends to be a little faster and more aggressive, so I would recommend using slow and quiet speaking during parts of the opening that you want to be the most dramatic - when the officer is hurt. Because there were no particular points of emphasis, my attention wasn't called to the important parts of the story.	8	Loved your storytelling voice! Great use of pacing, tone, and breaking down the elements of the case, very clear. Make sure to practice your movement during statements. Sometimes when we get nervous we move a lot. For you, it looks like you rock and move your hands a lot so try practicing your stance in the mirror.	6	6	3	7	Very natural acting, which I have a personal likeness toward. The consistent character traits were great to see, I could definitely describe the characteristics of this character which is the goal. I'm not typically a big fan of thematics, but I'd suggest making the witness a little more notable by highlighting a particular character trait to focus on in the acting just a little more. Be careful not to rock in your chair. It's a little difficult to hear you, so I'd keep that in mind for your positioning with your computer/room choice.	Nice job on cross, I thought you fought and elaborated a good amount but didn't overdo it and didn't come across as unnecessarily aggressive. Similar notes as direct about character.	Your tone for questions is really good, but it looks like you are looking for the next question on a document that you aren't really paying attention to what she's saying.  This examination is going very quickly because there's no space between answer and question so make sure to pause so that it appears like you aren't reading off a script. Really good response for the hearsay within hearsay objection. Focus on your witness during her cross, you're moving around a lot and looking elsewhere which can make it look like you aren't focused on protecting your witness.	Your demeanor on cross-examination is amazing. Very confident! You made quite a few objections during this cross examination but seemed like you gave up on them pretty quickly. This tells me you either knew it wasn't objectionable and objected anyway or you do automatic hearsay objections (a good amount were hearsay). Make sure to limit your objections to ones you feel comfortable arguing. I think if you were more memorized, it would do a lot for your performance as well - especially in terms of when the witness doesn't give you the answer you were expecting because you'll be able to focus on the answer and not the question you ask next. Also, make sure not to say "let's move on then" or "ok then" because it sounds like you didn't get the response you were looking for and then moved on. Nice impeachment!	8	8	6	4	Another natural witness! Your answers are very responsive and the acting was very calm. I'm a big fan of natural witnesses, but the acting can be a smidge more elaborate. "I'm not doing charity work" was a great line because of the way you said it and it gave a little extra character.	Nice balance of arguing and revealing information.	Your questioning looks like you're very focused on your witness's answers and responding to what she's saying, which is great! Very responsive and present! Slow down a bit in your questioning, this will help with the flow of the questioning which can get a little choppy. This attorney witness pairing looks like they work really well together. When the judge left it looked like you were talking to someone, which looks like you were getting an answer to the objection - be careful here because you are still in court and still in your direct examination. If you are bringing in any statement, make sure to make mental note of whether any hearsay objection could be made so that you can be prepared for that objection.	Nice hearsay objection, but I think you need to be prepared to make that objection a bit more. Seems like you didn't know exactly why you were making it at times. You made hearsay objection a couple of times and then agreed it was hearsay so make sure not to over object. Great use of tone. Make sure not to interrupt the witness, it's unnecessarily aggressive. The witness was fighting you a bit and you have to be careful of controlling the witness versus interrupting the witness and reasking the question many times - at that point just object nonresponsive. Ending every question with correct or right makes it come off as unnatural. I liked that you were to the witness's answers. You can slow down with your questions a bit, I think you sped up more towards the end of the examination. It feels a little more like fact after the fact rather than storytelling, or choppy, as a result. A the beginning you made a lot more use of tone, but as you got deeper into the questions I think you lost that a little. It was great when you used it so keep it consistent.	5	4	8	7	You're going a bit quickly which is making it more difficult to follow your testimony. I love how confident your portrayal is. You mentioned your dad was killed on the job indicating it was impactful to your career, play into this a bit more with the way you act when you discuss it. It's personal, not a qualification so here's your chance for character. Your directing attorney is in your background which is breaking the illusion of court, make sure that this doesn't happen during competition. I like that your character has a bit of theatrics, this should be reflected more in the acting so that you can slow down and not be as loud. Nice responses to objections - you focused on the argument without getting distracted. You can tell you were paying attention when the questioning started back up again.	Your loudness and elaboration is coming across as unnecessarily aggressive on cross-examination which made me favor your crossing attorney here. At one point your crossing attorney stopped trying to control you as much and I think you picked up on that and started fighting more, which showed me you're paying attention to the crosser. Just make sure not to overdo it.	I can tell you're a bit nervous and it's resulting in very quick speaking. Make sure to slow down. You have great use of tone when used, this would be more prevalent if you go slower. This attorney and witness pair is very confident which is amazing!! But, the testimony is hard to follow because it's going too quickly. Your questioning is very responsive, which I love. Great objection responses! Very prepared. Don't get discouraged when your objections are overruled, a lot of judges won't have arguments they'll just rule. This is especially true when time is running short.	Asked to get advice from co-counsel. I actually liked the way that you did this. It's realistic and you did it in a way that didn't give off that you didn't know what you were doing, just that you wanted to get advice. But in mock trial you do have to be careful this kind of stuff because you want to show that you're prepared to handle your witness, not that your co-counsel is prepared for your witness. Great control of the witness on cross-examination without becoming aggressive. You seem very interested in your witness's responses, I think the most responsive cross I've seen and the most controlled cross so far. Be careful to respond to the witness and not react. Responding is going with the witness is telling you and trying to get your way and reacting is when we can tell you're frustrated with the answers your getting. You had more control at first, but after he kept fighting it looked like you started getting a little more frazzled when he wouldn't give you an expected answer. He was fighting a lot and after a certain point, I would object nonresponsive and then move for the witness to be limited to yes/no answers. Make sure not to respond to the witness with "ok" or "let's just move on" because it seems like you're giving up.	7	8	7	7	Your pacing is really good, you can definitely utilize tone more, and becoming memorized will help with your presentation.	Great work on cross being cooperative, but I do think that there were several times where your answers could reflect more character. At one point, there were five or six questions where you only said "yes." Great response when you weren't sure what your crossing attorney meant! You cued your attorney to object and fought as much as you reasonably could which is as good as you can get.	Your pacing, tone, and responsiveness were ideal for a direct examination. Your objection responses need work, you should look through your questions and go through every objection to practice your responses. On-the-spot responses seem to be where you struggle the most so I'd practice on-the-spot exercises. When things are going as expected, your presentation is great.	Great objection right off the bat!  You're very good at articulating what you're trying to say, which can be very difficult in mock trial since it's quick and complicated. You slowed down and were a lot more responsive on cross than on direct so this was definitely my preferred performance. Sometimes your confidence waivers when you're not sure of something, just keep going and maintain your confidence. As judges, we're more likely to question the admissibility of something based on your response to an objection.	8	7	9	8	This was the best acting I saw all trial, great work! I could tell you were empathetic towards the victim and concerned about the case appealing to my emotion and not just logic as most other witnesses did. I still think you can do even more with your responses though, sadder or more concerned, and add a little more character.	I feel like you lost a lot of confidence at this point because you couldn't hear your crossing attorney. Don't worry about that, it happened. Make sure to keep up the confidence!	Nice slow pace comes off across as confident and listening to the witness as opposed to reading off questions. I think the best way to elevate your presentation would be to memorize your questions to a point where you can ask the questions without hesitation and without looking at a document- these didn't happen often but occasionally during your questioning.	The leading objection wasn't leading, but you stuck by your argument argued something, and maintained your argument which was ideal for the situation. \r\n\r\nYou slowed down a lot here compared to your direct examination, so I preferred this examination from you. The way you articulated and presented your questions were consistent, easy to follow, and captured my attention in a way most other exams didn't because you used to tone and emphasis combined with varying speed. When you want to limit a witness to yes/no answers you should object to nonresponsive and then ask the judge to limit the witness's testimony to yes/no answers. I originally was going to give you a 9 for this cross, but you kept interrupting the witness which I don't think was necessary so be careful when you're trying to witness control not to try and overcontrol to a point where it seems more aggressive than neessary.	9	9	6	6	I like the character and that you didn't overdo the character! If you were memorized you will come off as significantly less scripted. It's apparent you're reading which is breaking the illusion. Personally, I don't like accents but if you do them you have to commit to the character. Memorization would probably be the best thing you could do for your character so that you can focus on how you're saying things AND what you're saying, not just what you're saying. Make sure your facial expressions fit the character. Body language is very important.	"I'm sorry darling" was a great character line. Very sweet character on cross, but you maintained a confident persona that sounded like you would be able to fight. You kept up a great use of tone, volume, and pacing in cross as you did in direct which is a typical issue, great job here!	Slow down your questioning to make it flow more naturally. You have amazing confidence, it makes me want to believe everything you say. The way you talk changed a lot between your opening to hear. Use the tone and speed skills that you showed in your opening in your questioning as well. Also, great on-spot responses	Very similar comments to your cross. Your on-the-spot arguments tend to be a little scattered, it would probably help to slow down and take the steps of your argument one point at a time. Keep up your confidence!! I'm very similar where I will appear less confident the more I tend to stutter, but learning to maintain your confidence comes with practice and feeling comfortable in your material so really get to know your material and why you're asking what you're asking.	7	Your storytelling ability was really really present in your closing. Appropriate variation of volume, pace, and tone was prevalent. I think you could've been slower when telling the story of what happened that night for more emphasis on the injustice in the injury. While there is variation, you consistently use loudness and fastness as your typical speaking style, make sure to balance that out otherwise it's hard to know what parts to really pay attention to. You are very passionate though and will the mentioned adjustments that passion would be highlighted a lot more. Time ran out so make sure to adjust to the time constraints.	8	I thought your presentation was amazing. Definitely the best statement of the case because of your presentation. You can slow down a bit for emphasis and utilize quietness at certain points to help. The repetition in the closing with "...No.." didn't really work with how it's presented so I'd adjust that or take that out. I think you can use a better analogy than the flower, but I like your use of an analogy.	33	169	203	127	130	133	132	205	129	134	t

70	7	-Good use of hand gestures, only thing that I will say is to make them higher. It might be just because you are using your phone that your gestures were cut off but make sure we can see your hands if you are using them! \r\n- On that same note, by holding your hands in front of you as a neutral position, it makes me think you're nervous. Try just having them at your side.\r\n- I really like your storytelling BUT I would add some "the evidence will show" in your opening to make it not so argumentative. \r\n- I noticed that when you started talking about the witnesses, you had 30 seconds left. Cut some story so you can spend more time on your elements and witnesses.\r\n- Also weave pieces of evidence and testimony into your opening to help frame your case-in-chief better. I feel like your opening was largely telling the story, which can be good, but I think using evidence that will come out in the trial will make this good opening great.	8	- I think it'll do you some good take a step back from the camera so that you could use the space. \r\n- Theme is always first, good, and good being responsive. \r\n- I'm not the biggest fan of your theme, it's a very generic mock trial theme for the defense. However, if you are able to weave this theme into your story, it'll work.\r\n- With your "three question" gesture, hold it up higher. I want to see the three! \r\n- While opposing counsel had too much storytelling, I feel like you did not have enough. You use the evidence very well but now you just need storytelling! Jury members LOVE to hear a story and make them follow your case better.	7	7	6	8	- I like the background!\r\n- Good come back from the objection.\r\n- Your answers are too long, it can be narrative. Opposing counsel objected to lack of foundation, which I sustained, but I would have sustained a narrative or non-responsive.\r\n- I'm not a big fan of character witnesses but I feel like you could use some character!	-You don't know what the control panel does? Didn't you say that you knew what they were on direct?\r\n- You fought where you needed, which is good.\r\n- You don't think someone was shooting a gun at you? How would you not know? This made me take a point off from you.	-Make sure you are in sync with your witness. I noticed sometimes he kept speaking when you wanted to ask your question.\r\n- Formalize your objection responses\r\n- Some of your questions were leading. Had opposing counsel objected to leading, I might have sustained them. \r\n- You get nervous when there is an objection. Her objections weren't great so you had nothing to worry about. \r\n- Some judges will not let you take a moment to talk to your teammates, don't count on it. Think about why opposing counsel is wrong. \r\n- Do not end on objection, even if you win.	- You are on your feet with these objections, but I think you could have gotten him on some narrative or non-responsive objection.\r\n- More prejudicial than probative needs to be SUBSTANTIALLY more prejudicial than probative. This means that the evidence coming in would need to be so bad that it is unfair. Saying that someone was acting strange isn't so bad. \r\n- I noticed that you like lack of foundation objections a lot. I think what you might be looking for is a leading objection. Lack of foundation is when something isn't on the record but opposing counsel is acting like it is.\r\n- Make sure to listen and write down what your witness has said. Some of the lack of foundation\r\n- I took off two points because of the objections and the lack of responses.\r\n- I might have missed it, did he ever say that he knew what the "mind eraser" control panel was?\r\n- I think your questions are really good, but he was giving you some bad answers that you could have used. He said he didn't think someone was shooting a gun at him. He didn't think?	7	8	8	8	- Move back from the camera, half of your head was cutoff during your testimony. \r\n- You make me believe that you are a tired, upset park owner! \r\n- I feel though that you can add some phrases that bring your character together instead of being serious all the time. I'm not saying to add jokes, I'm saying you should add some personality to your witness.\r\n- Make sure to listen to the objection battles. I just said that it would not use it to show conformity.	- I liked how you always got a little bit of exposition out with the opposing counsel's questions.\r\n- She had some good questions but it wasn't bad for your case. You brushed it off pretty well.	- I like that you got onto your computer, but now make sure to step back so I can see the rest of you! \r\n- Never say "I think". Juries don't care about what you think, they care about facts.\r\n- Wording is very important. What Longstreet said was a statement but you said it wasn't. Objection battles can be stressful but it is okay to take a moment.\r\n- Never end on an objection.	- Listen to the testimony, improper opinion is for experts only. The hearsay objection was the way to go.\r\n- Speculation is reaching into the mindset of someone else. She was not reaching into the mindset of anyone and had reasons to believe it, so it was not speculation.\r\n- Your instincts for objections are good, just make sure to know what the objections are!\r\n- I would have tried to keep Exhibit 4 out.\r\n- Him asking about whether or not she thinks that someone can make a mistake is objectionable. Your speculation objection was good but changing it to prejudicial objection was the bad move. Improper opinion would have been good too.\r\n- Last speculation objection was good. It was exactly what I was thinking.\r\n- Short Cross examination. You got in, got your points, and got out. Maybe add like one more sort of "box" and you'll be golden.	7	7	7	9	- It looks like you are reading. I'm not going to mark you down for it but just wanted to let you know.\r\n- I know you are pressed for time but in the future when you are not, make sure to slow down.\r\n- Same with the last witness, add some personality. You can be a little bit more detective like! But you are a good detective character, it just needs a little more.	- You sort of let her run all over you. There were parts where you fought, but they were during your bias box so it made you seem more biased in my eyes. Try to come up with different responses.\r\n- For this lack of personal knowledge objection, you can say that you don't know to some things! \r\n- I believe that you had one more question for direct, I would try to get whatever you wanted to testify to on that question in the direct.\r\n- You probably don't have evidence? Be confident, yes or no.	- I understand you are pressed for time, just in the future make sure to slow down. Your pre-trial was also quick. Take a breath and slow down.\r\n- I don't know if you need to tender an expert in PPMT so if you do then good job. If not, then it is not needed.\r\n- Good bounce back from the sustained objection. However, look at the rules 703 and 705. They can help when an objection like lack of foundation when working with experts.\r\n- The wristbands mean that the defendant helped with the robbery? If it doesn't, then there is no truth value and therefore not hearsay.\r\n- When you agree during an objection battle, you lose.	- Look at rules 703 and 705. For experts, you don't necessarily need to lay foundation right away. \r\n- Good hearsay objection, you got him to mess up on his response and got the testimony kept out.\r\n- Excellent bias box right out the back. I like bias boxes right at the front. \r\n- Good response to the prejudicial objection. I would not say "the bar is really high", I would say that the evidence needs to be SUBSTANTIALLY outweighed by the danger of misleading the jury instead. \r\n- Very good examination.	8	8	8	8	- You are a good defendant, you seem remorseful. \r\n- Good job owning up to what you did wrong and trying to spin it to show that you weren't involved with taking money.\r\n- You have good moments of sadness.	- Nice job staying on character during cross examination.\r\n-  Good job saying that you knew but weren't involved. \r\n- You do a good job to going back to being sad and sympathetic.	- You are confident, you have good presence.\r\n- Be careful with leading questions in direct. I think they are important during a direct with the defendant but you are liable to objections. \r\n- You have good questions, they flow very naturally and tell a story.\r\n- 803(3) does not need to be all of the states of mind. Your response was good that it didn't show motive, I just wanted the text messages to come in. \r\n- Good redirect to explain the text messages.\r\n- You are admitting that your defendant was in a conspiracy with the person that committed the crime? That's basically admitting that she did it! You lost a point from me for this. And then you wanted the bad statements to come in that would be bad for your case!	- Be careful with objections that are right at the beginning of the examination, especially when it is with the defendant. \r\n- Make sure to listen to the testimony.\r\n- You end a lot of questions with "is that correct" or "is that true?". It can be a little repetitive so be careful with doing it so much. \r\n- Make sure to have your tech ready. \r\n- Use plan instead of motive, that will be your way in with the text messages. \r\n- You are a little aggressive with this sad witness. Be careful with coming off as aggressive. \r\n- Do not say "whatever" to what the witness is saying. \r\n- You also repeat her name multiple times, that is also repetitive.\r\n- Your hearsay objection did not sit well with me but you got her to say that they were proving a conspiracy so that was good.	10	8	8	9	- GOOD CHARACTER, lots of personality. \r\n- "Blackest day" I know this was supposed to be sad but I thought it was funny and in character for something this character would say! I would add more things likes this in the direct.	- Keep the character up during cross examination! \r\n- You can pick places to explain more! Don't get afraid by him saying that you have redirect!\r\n- Try not to admit to lying. It hurts your credibility. \r\n- You just agree with everything he is asking you! Fight sometimes or use your personality to wiggle out of his questions! \r\n- Oh okay you get sad when you talk about the knife bit. I liked that!	- Don't get thrown off by the objections! Just bounce back like it never bothered you.\r\n- Good job with the "who was holding the knife" and establishing that it was only one person and not the defendant.	- Good speculation objection\r\n- I don't like you telling her about redirecting. \r\n- I like you better on cross examination than direct examination. You seem more confident on cross.\r\n- You end a lot of questions with "is that correct?". It gets repetitive and easy to tune out. \r\n- Be careful about asking if they lied. It can be argumentative.\r\n- Good job attacking the bias! \r\n- Be careful with snapping back at the witness. You said "just answer yes or no thank you". She was talking about a traumatic experience, you can be nicer.	9	8	8	8	- Nice character! Lots of personality but not too much!\r\n- I like your explanation of being an operator. \r\n- Good jokes!	- Keep your personality on cross examination! I think it would be a good way to get out of some of his questions.\r\n- You can fight more a bit more during your cross. You do not have to agree with everything the attorney is saying unless it says so in your affidavit.	- Your questions could sound more inquisitive, meaning you can sound a bit more interested in her answers. Like when you ask about what an operator does. \r\n- You have a good flow of questions!\r\n- I think you can have some more fun with this witness! You can play off of her personality a bit more. You smile at her but you can do more!	- "have you ever seen her do anything dishonest?" You should have objected to improper character evidence.\r\n- You say "am I correct?" at the end of your questions a lot, it gets repetitive really quick, especially if your teammates also do it. \r\n- Good job at bringing up the bad facts!\r\n- She said a few things that you could have picked up on, like when she said that	9	- Do not tell the judge how to judge. I don't mind but some people might not like it. \r\n- I like that you stand, but I would try to bring the camera up to eye level. If this is not possible with your space, don't worry about it, I did not mark you down for it. \r\n- I like the demo a lot! It breaks down the case so that the jury can easily digest it. \r\n- You have a good structure for your closing and you are attacking defenses future points. \r\n- You bring a lot of pieces of evidence and bring it together into an argument, this is very good.\r\n- Be careful with saying "members of the jury" repeatedly. \r\n- Be careful calling witnesses liars. It can come off as harsh to some judges. \r\n- I didn't catch your theme though. Make sure to weave this into your entire case from opening to closings. \r\n- Your attack on coincidences was really good! \r\n- You are a lot more confident on closing than the rest of the trial. Try to bring this energy to the rest of the trial.\r\n- I wouldn't spend a lot of time talking about the job that the jury has.\r\n\r\nREBUTTAL:\r\n- Good job responding.\r\n- The defense does not have to prove anything, you said they didn't prove their argument.	9	- Good job bringing back the theme at the beginning of the closing.\r\n- Nice bringing us back to a crucial point of the trial.\r\n- Good job talking about the burden. I wrote that you should talk more about reasonable doubt and then you did, nice!!\r\n- I think instead of framing it with the three questions from opening, you should frame it against the elements. The elements are how you get the verdict, how you attack the prosecution, and how you win a jury over.\r\n- You should hold up your gestures a bit more, they are getting cut off by the screen. \r\n- Good job weaving moments of the trial back into the argument.	22	114	20	113	114	16	15	14	18	112	t
85	7	Knew, conspired, lied.\r\n\r\nIt's quite obvious you're reading from a script - try working with presentation and delivery a bit more.\r\n\r\nBring in demonstrations with your counts, they're quite complicated. I'm also not hearing enough about the burden.\r\n\r\nNo need to go into so much about the specifics of the bracelets and the theme in the opening.	9	Three actors, one scapegoat, and one victim.\r\n\r\nLove the theme. Love the theory. The narrative could be a bit stronger, tie in a bit more rhetoric re. how the prosecution's story is wrong.	7	6	8	8	Let's hear more character than just "I'm Chinese" - that's a relatively low effort character and you don't do much to sustain it.	Maybe?\r\n\r\nAiya impeachment. When the oc looks like he's super confident and about to impeach maybe just concede to it.	Do you know him - how do you know him?\r\n\r\nGood hearsay responses.\r\n\r\nNot state of mind - has to be then existing not remembered.\r\n\r\nNever end on an objection.	Hearsay hearsay hearsay, improper opinion.\r\n\r\nGood asking for a yes when she said maybe.\r\n\r\nNo need to ask to share/impeach.\r\n\r\nSome of the points you could've gone further with, especially the one's that feed your theme well, the fact that she's not even sure if she saw the right person, for instead, really grill the witness with that.	6	6	7	9	Your necklace reflects light and it's slightly distracting.\r\n\r\nWhere's the character?	You're conceding a bit too much.\r\n\r\nYou giving out VIP tickets shouldn't be a big deal for you.	It doesn't matter what the witness thinks.\r\n\r\nNever! end on an objection.	You're doing really great Jasmine, but you're slightly more aggressive than you need to be.	7	6	6	7	You simply don't sound like an expert to me. Work with your diction, voice, and presentation. This is a very weak expert with not enough evidence to back up her claims but you need to make that up with your experty-appearance.	You're conceding too much here.	Where are the responses!	You look like youre standing in space.\r\n\r\nThis expert barely has anything to back up her conclusions, you need to grill her harder.	7	7	7	7	BRIT. I'm looking for more character here.		You have good questions but I want you to be more purposeful with your questions. Loop in your case theory - you have a good theory but I'm not hearing much of it in this direct.	Show not tell.\r\n\r\nYou have good points but we need to emphasize those points more.	8	8	8	7	Love the energy here.\r\n\r\nWe're lacking foundation here. What did you hear in the call, how do you know its his employee, etc.		You do a good job sign posting and guiding the witness with your questions, but you do tend to lack some foundation.	Control the witness a bit more - she was fighting a lot when she shouldn't be, and you could've pointed that out.	9	7	9	7	I like the tone.\r\n\r\nLove the emotion. Feeds your theory well.	A bit too much on cross. This happened years ago. You're crying too much.\r\n\r\nThe lies - I want to here you fight a bit more here.	The finger lol. Good good but make it more obvious.	Let's not interrupt the witness's answer. No need to ask for permission to screen share.\r\n\r\nAccident? She didn't pull the lever on accident, grill her on that, don't let her get away with it.\r\n\r\nLies lies lies.	9	I'm not hearing enough on intent and plan; oc is arguing that she hit the lever by mistake, make sure you counter that.\r\n\r\nExplain the counts. There's 5 elements and the jury doesn't know that. Do your three questions cover both charges? I'm not so sure.\r\n\r\nI'd want to hear more damning evidence re. the fact that she was planning it apart from the fact that she panicked.\r\n\r\nStress a bit more the fact that she asked 8 times to take control - that's not a mistake, its deliberate, intentional, planned, directly counters defense theory.\r\n\r\nI'm not hearing a lot of references to in-court testimonies.\r\n\r\nThe lies - I want to hear that more throughout the trial.	8	Actor, scapegoat, victim - I want to hear these words throughout the trial.\r\n\r\nBurden good good.\r\n\r\nMOMENT in today's trial.\r\n\r\nThe betrayed rhetoric - it's an empty argument, you need to back it up.	16	166	99	171	105	172	100	104	169	103	t
74	6	Not much of a coherent theme at the beginning, would try and sum up your overall argument for the prosecution in one or two sentences, so that the jury and the judge have a reference for the case will present\r\n\r\nGood pace, very clear speaking style. Good establishment of the burden of the prosecution. I like the stair analogy for beyond a reasonable doubt, but I would elaborate on it a bit more.	8	"Truth is found by facts, not by impressions." - Good and concise theme, albeit a bit generic and not quite specific to the case itself. \r\n\r\nAccident theory -- Whit bowman did not intend to pull the lever. I appreciate the volume and the tone of the opening, but I would slow down just a little bit. I understood your argument from your theme, but I got lost a little bit as you began to elaborate and began to speed up throughout the speech.\r\n\r\nThree Points\r\n\r\n1. How should bowman be responsible for financial theft even if there is no evidence?\r\n\r\n2. Has longstreet been ever investigated for the park's finances?\r\n\r\n3. Did bowman panic at the dire moment?\r\n\r\nI would not characterize sending a man into a coma to be a mistake. I like the dichotomy between facts and impressions that you establish throughout the speech	8	6	7	8	I would slow down a little bit, I think your pace is pretty good, but slowing down just a little more would make sure that both judges can pick up everything.\r\n\r\nOtherwise quite charming witness.	Good responsiveness to the crossing attorney. Not too fighty, which is always appreciated. But at the same time, you are the owner of the park where one of your employees is comatose! There's a certain degree of righteous anger to be had.	Make sure you have all of your materials for direct examination prepared for trial, while I don't mind brief delays, other judges might not be so open. \r\n\r\nDefense objected to lack of foundation to Billie Isaacs, and I sustained the objection, so I would go ahead and lay the foundation, otherwise weakens your argument\r\n\r\nWould try and object during cross examination to break up the flow of the crossing attorney.	Pretty good hearsay objection to the excited utterance, and good lack of foundation objection. I thought you argued your sides well for both objections, but I would slow down in speaking.\r\n\r\nTry and limit the use of "like" in your speech. \r\n\r\nGood establishment of what the witness knows and doesn't know.\r\n\r\nAvoid interrupting the witness.	8	5	8	5	Good pacing! I think that you're quite a believable witness during direct examination. I would elaborate and explain your machine learning method a bit more -- I was lost on the normal vs. anomaly dichotomy	Cross examination is taxing on every witness (trust me, I've faltered a lot on cross before). Try and keep up a consistent tone of confidence during cross examination! Otherwise, pretty solid answers to cross.	Experts are allowed to use otherwise inadmissible hearsay if it informs their conclusions. While I appreciate the public office exception for exhibit 6 (haven't heard it in my mock trial rounds haha), it doesn't apply here. \r\n\r\nGood thinking on your feet during objection arguments. While I didn't agree with some of your pivots, I appreciate the adaptability.\r\n\r\nI allowed the impeachment to occur for the sake of it, but in future trials, if the crossing attorney does not go through the correct steps for impeachment, object to improper impeachment.	Pretty good objection to lack of foundation -- it's splitting straws when we discuss what "working" in the robbery department means, but as a general rule of thumb, that's usually enough to show expertise, as in it's usually rationally assumable that they are experts in robbery based on work experience.\r\n\r\nDidn't go through the steps of impeachment. 1. You remember preparing an affidavit 2. You remember that you have had up until today to change it etc. \r\n\r\nLet the witness finish their answers.\r\n\r\nGood objection to hearsay to exhibit 6. Always try to have a response to objection arguments. I understand the need to consult with counsel at times, trust me, I've done it before, but keep things brief and try to have responses ready to go as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nGood tone for witness control. Watch out for attorney testifying objections/testifying to facts not yet in evidence. \r\n\r\nGood establishment of contradictory facts in testimony.	7	7	7	5	I like this witness! My only advice would be to be more emphatic and bombastic! Good witnesses have personality and character, whether that be through jokes or tone.	I appreciate the pronunciation correction, but some judges might see that as unfriendly and may dock points.\r\n\r\nGood job with not giving the crossing attorney any freebies and asking them to clarify when necessary, shows that you know your facts with depth.	Good back and forth with witness, with good pace and volume.	Allow the witness to finish their answers. Different judges have different opinions on interrupting witnesses for witness control, but I personally do not like it. Would prefer to keep cross examination questions to leading questions (don't ask them to identify what the stop button is).	9	8	8	6	I like the sweater - much welcome change from all the suits of mock trial. I noticed you speeding up at times during the testimony, so I would watch your pacing, but otherwise very expressive witness.	Good responses to cross examination questions. Not too fighty with crossing attorney.\r\n\r\nGood job making the crossing attorney clarify their questions.	Direct examination is paced quite well, it's slow and clear. I noticed that your eyes wander a lot during both direct and cross examination, and while I'm not asking you to stare daggers into the computer screen, try and maintain consistent eye contact. Good rapport with witness. \r\n\r\nGreat badgering the witness objection.	I appreciate the thought to the first lack of foundation objection, but typically refrain from objecting when the witness is just introducing themselves.	9	9	8	8	I love the character, great energy and pace. Good humor without making it obnoxious like a lot of character witnesses in mock trial. Believable witness as well.	Good humor with cross answers without sounding ridiculous. Good responsiveness to the crossing attorney.	Good rapport with witness, love the banter. This witness is very energetic and it's always good as a directing attorney to match the witness' energy.	Character witnesses are hard to cross especially with unexpected jokes for answers. Good job not being fazed by the witness and keeping a consistent tone.	8	6	6	8	Apologies if this isn't intentional, but I appreciate the character of the disaffected park worker. The portrayal of regret is pretty good!	Pretty good cross responses. Also good job on maintaining the character/overall energy of direct into cross examination. Don't say that "you guess" it's illegal to lie to the police.	Solid rapport with the witness, especially the defendant.	Pretty good speculation objections, but I thought that lack of foundation worked a bit better there. If the defense is going to refer to text message exhibits that are already in evidence, I would object 10-02 to best evidence. \r\n\r\nDon't interrupt witnesses. I know this is the defendant, so there's a bit more leeway with harsher witness control, but let them finish. Otherwise it makes it seem that the defendant has testimony that you don't want the jury to hear.	7	Speeches are very hard to remember, but really try to commit to memorization rather than reading from cards. Good recall back to opening statements and good variance of tone and pace. Good emphasis of damning quotes. Great recap of the evidence presented by the prosecution. Solid rebuttal given the time constraints.	9	Good repetition of theme. I like the emphasis and variance in tone and pace throughout the pace. It's also good to really emphasize what beyond a reasonable doubt means. BaRD means that even if the jury thinks it's likely, that's not enough. Even if the jury thinks that it's probable, that's not enough. The prosecution has to address ALL plausible doubts in their case. Don't try and refute the prosecution's argument yourself, I understand that there may be holes to poke, but you have to show us what evidence you and your counsel showed that refutes the prosecution's argument.	18	109	63	135	128	65	62	64	131	130	t
82	8	Good job starting with a theme. Clear statement of the facts. Good job stating the charges and summarizing the law.  Good work changing the tone and volume of your voice. Be careful making arguments within your open. There were times where you would say, "You will hear ..." which is fine, but then you'd say, "And then she lied". Make sure you keep stating things like, "The evidence will show ..".	8	I like that you started with your theme. You have a great voice for opening as you are a great storyteller. Good work changing up your tone and volume and speed. I liked the use of the demonstrative for the open. I would recommend that you use both arms throughout - you used your right arm almost exclusively for a few minutes and then switched to your left arm.	8	7	7	8	Good character as the rich/slick business owner. Good energy.	A little combative during cross, but not too far out of character.	Good interested tone in your questions. Kind of a stretch on the argumentative objections, but I would have sustained these objections based on Mr. Wang's air quotes if you had gone that route.	Good objections and well argued.  I'm a little confused by the first couple of questions on cross. Was that this witness' statements from within their affidavit or did you mean testimony? I would not use air quotes during questioning, I feel that it is argumentative. There is a better way to do this.	9	9	8	8	Love the character. Excellent job being sort of off camera like an older person likely would be on Zoom. Good answers.	Good job not being too defensive, but also not just giving yes and no answers.	Good interested tone. Clear questions where you let a strong witness be the star.	Nooooo!  I was in agreement with you that your opposing counsel's questions were leading "Did you meet anyone along the way". They aren't too bad, but I would have sustained that objection and told them to rephrase. Don't roll over too quick on those objections, stick to your argument.  Good witness control and good cross.	7	7	7	9	Solid law enforcement character. If you are aware that your witness has experience in robbery investigation, you need to be clear with that.	Good consistency across direct and cross, not too argumentative (although I don't think it was necessary to remind the attorney that you are a detective).	Good direct. Good job bouncing back from not getting the witness tendered as a robbery expert. If there is evidence within that report that this witness does have investigative experience in robbery, you need to find it.  Careful with time, not your fault since it's a culmination of all of your witnesses, but it still affects your score if you can't finish all of your questions.	Really good job on the voir dire and handling of the robbery. I wish you would have renewed your objection regarding the knife as they did not establish foundation. You could have kept 5 out, I think there was plenty of truth value to all of the statements given the context of the message. Good witness control on cross. Your next step is to switch up your tone here and there for effect.	8	7	7	8	Great energy. Fun witness to watch and you were able to remain credible. Talk to your coaches about your testimony, I think there's quite a bit of speculation regarding the books.	Good job keeping up the character and energy on cross. I would work on a few of your answer as they undermine your credibility.	Hunter, I can see that you are wearing shorts or PJs with your sport coat. You have to be aware of your positioning on the screen if you aren't going to be wearing a full suit.	I would have objected to speculation or relevance to quite a bit of this testimony (specifically about the books she found).	10	8	8	7	Very believable witness. Excellent job. Perfect balance between sad, but determined.	It kinds of sounds like you are slipping into a southern accent, which doesn't match your voice from the direct exam and I don't think it is necessary. Great answers for cross for the most part. Careful with the length of some of those responses, I'm surprised you weren't objected to for being non-responsive.	Good job switching your tone from your earlier cross to a softer direct exam tone. Good, short questions. You really want to let this witness be the star.	I like it when cross attorneys start with a hard hitting question, but you need to be clear what you are asking, "You need money?" was your question, but everyone needs money. I would re-write those questions so it is clear what you are referring to. It might be helpful to screen share the exhibit of the control panel to drive your point home about the lever and stop button. You could control the witness a little firmer, she's going to give you more than just yes and no answers, but there were several times where she went on and on without you intervening. Good job on the impeachment, but you need to take a firmer tone with this witness, she is getting way too off track and you are going to run out of time.	7	7	8	7	Good character, but you have to be careful with this type of character to make sure that you stay credible. You need to smooth out your delivery, you have a staccato delivery that is a little distracting.	Consistent with your behavior and you come across like you aren't biased, which is good. You still need to smooth your delivery out.	Great voice for direct exam. Good questions with the time that you had. Good hearsay objection, that I would probably have sustained if we had more time to discuss, but given we only have 12 minutes left, we had to move forward.	Good job with the time that you had. I think you could have eliminated a few of your questions to be a bit more concise with what you had to work with.	8	Great control and good review of the evidence. I think a demonstrative during your closing would really hammer things home.	8	Good job poking holes in the prosecution's theory. I really like that you used the demonstrative during the close. I can see your computer screen in your glasses and watching your eyes, I suspect you might be reading your closing. I'm not sure, so I'm not going to ding your score on this, but you need to be careful about that.	26	154	4	1	8	2	7	13	3	11	t

Demeanor seemed to stay consistent on cross, you weren't fighting too much. \r\n\r\nMaybe could have elaborated on more answers, but I don't think the points were really hurting you so it was fine.	Smooth use of the exhibit, I like drawing attention to the $500 number in the law.\r\n\r\nGood job connecting points back to your theory and theme.\r\n\r\nYou could vary the tone of your questions a bit more to sound more like you're having a conversation with the witness, right now it sounds a bit static.\r\n\r\nExcellent objections, great job explaining the issues clearly and not letting the opposing counsel distract from them. Love the reference to the character evidence form.	Not quite clear how those initial questions are supposed to connect to your case — are we supposed to think she's lying about Bowman because she's a bad boss? \r\n\r\nI'm glad that you're eager to say as much as you can in those objection responses, but you'll be more effective if you relax a bit — no need to rush, just take a deep breath and lay out your arguments one by one. It seems like you're shooting in the dark with some of those responses, try to take more time to think about what the actual issue is that they're objecting rather than giving a generic response.\r\n\r\nAfter I said you could ask when the statement was made to lay foundation for your hearsay exception, you just moved on — try to show that you can be responsive to my rulings.	9	10	10	6	I like the high-energy character, your big gestures and voice make it easy to listen to you.\r\n\r\nThe whole "this is embarrassing" answer is a fun way to maintain character even when admitting to a fact that might be bad for you.\r\n\r\nGood job not losing character after those objection arguments.	Very good character on cross, you managed to put a spin on almost every bad fact while still seeming like a real person and being fun to listen to.\r\n\r\nEnjoyed that you actually responded to the attorney's rhetorical comments like "good morning," great way to steal the show for a moment.	Great tone with the witness, very gentle and conversational.\r\n\r\nLove the objection responses, especially the first 403 one. Hit all the points you needed to very precisely.	I like that you went for some objections, but more prejudicial than probative is often a weak one to default to unless there's a serious issue with the testimony\r\n\r\nWatch out for the distinction between a party opponent (the opposite party in the case) and party representative (someone a party picks to sit in the courtroom and represent them). Bowman is always the state's party opponent, whether or not they're your party representative.\r\n\r\nYou almost went into that point you were making in the objection about how he can't tell us how far apart that button and lever were, which was great! But then you backed off at the last moment.\r\n\r\nGood job trying to control the witness when he was being especially evasive.	8	6	8	9	Fairly straightforward and credible performance, not a ton of character but I don't think you need it on a witness like this especially after the last two.	Good use of some facts, but watch out for your demeanor while being crossed — you slip into a combative or even hostile tone that makes you seem more biased than you otherwise would. A professional detective should have no issue freely admitting what their investigation did and did not include.	I like the bold direct structure, goes right at some very strong points. \r\n\r\nSolid objection responses, though I think you lean a bit too heavily on the witness simply being an expert — you still need to explain at least on a very broad level how she's reaching the conclusions she's reaching with the information that she has.	Good objections! I think you could have objected to this witness's expertise in general, but I also like the approach you went with of focusing on the most important facts they tried to bring in.\r\n\r\nNice use of omissions to push on things this witness didn't see or doesn't know.\r\n\r\nGreat job keeping your demeanor constant when the witness was fighting heavily, while always bringing it back to your question.\r\n\r\nCross could be shorter, but I understand that the wtin	9	6	8	8	I like how even though you're trying to get the jury's sympathy, you're not just playing the defendant as a meek victim, but as someone with a strong personality.\r\n\r\nGood emotion at the climax of the story.	I like that you push back on some facts, it definitely makes sense for a defendant to be fighting on cross. But watch out for some of those unnecessary quibbles on how many times he's asked something and the wording he uses — you can agree to some questions and fight on the most important ones.	Nice structure on a lot of these questions.\r\n\r\nA little strange telling your own client to calm down.\r\n\r\nGood job objecting hearsay to the texts that are not from Bowman, I think there's a solid argument either way on the co-conspirator issue.	I see where you're coming from with that 403 objection, but it feels a bit weird to object to a Zoom background.\r\n\r\nGreat improper character evidence objection.\r\n\r\nI like the flow of your pockets, it's very clear what points you're making. You don't need to include all of them though, even if you had a less combative witness this is a very long cross.\r\n\r\nGood job really pushing for a yes when she was being evasive.	7	8	7	8	Not a very large character, but you seem pretty realistic.	Good job not seeming too fighty, and using enthusiastic agreement with their questions as a tactic for making them not land as well.\r\n\r\nI know it's always fun as a witness to phrase your answers in a way that gets around the rules of evidence, but actually saying "rational perception" is probably a bit much — that's not a phrase most people would use in day-to-day speach.	Good flow to the direct, but not super powerful in terms of the facts it adds to your case. I know you work with what you have but I can't help but wonder if there's a way you could have structured it to get some punchy moments.	Very efficient and to-the-point with these cross questions.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure what Exhibit 9 is doing for you, but I like the visual.\r\n\r\nSolid ending.	7	7	7	8	Solid character, not the most high-energy and it didn't seem incredibly consistent but I enjoyed it overall.	Some nice answers when they're questions weren't quite right.\r\n\r\nDon't use obvious time-wasting tactics just because you know the crossing attorney is short on time. If you're going to delay be subtle enough about it that I don't notice, otherwise you don't seem like a person called to testify in a trial, you seem like a mock trialer trying to hurt the other side's score.	Mostly good questions on direct, a couple awkward transitions.\r\n\r\nWork on how you respond to character evidence objections — I do think there's a strong argument that it was admissible, but just the fact that they're behaviors or the witness saw them doesn't mean they're not being used to show character, you have to explain what they are being used for.	I know you're short on time, but try not to just cut off the witness while she's in the middle of speaking.\r\n\r\nGot a bit messy in the middle, but good job ending on a strong note.	9	Very good tone for this closing, made it especially compelling and fun to listen to.\r\n\r\nI think there was a slight bit of weirdness in the three facts breakdown, it seemed like you folded aiding in the robbery into the knowledge section and it wasn't clear when you were talking about proving specifically turning the ride to blackout mode or just aiding in general.\r\n\r\nLove the timeline demo, I'm often not the biggest fan of timeline demos but this one made your case incredibly clear, worked super well.	9	Great way to start it off, the lack of scientific and financial evidence is probably your strongest point.\r\n\r\nLove the passion in your delivery, this is a very nice tone.\r\n\r\nGood use of standard defense closing rhetoric of leaning into burden, reasonable doubt, and presumption of innocence.	3	130	21	50	25	26	24	22	51	54	t
145	7	"What is more pathetic" is a bit too argumentative for opening. I also think that you introduced a lot of characters too quickly. It was a bit difficult to keep track of who was who. I liked your explanation of reasonable doubt. Overall, my biggest comment is that you could've used more tonal variation. "Using facts and evidence" <- in the expert witness part,  I think this was a little vague. I would've liked to hear what they based their conclusions on. I like the call to action at the end.	6	Also needs more tonal variation. Sounds like you're reading -- which I understand, but it makes it sound dispassionate. I liked the story you told, it is clear what the defense is going to argue. Explaining the law and burden dragged on a bit. I think you can paraphrase, or only mention the important parts. The whole opening sort of meshed together, pauses would help for transitions. Overall, good job making it clear what kind of person you are trying to show that Bowman is.	7	7	6	7	Mostly out of frame, didn't score for this, but would be easier to see you if you were centered. Seemed like a pretty real guy, believable witness. Good job getting agitated when you're telling to story of getting robbed.	Good job staying confident and believable. "Excuse me, what?" was a little abrasive. I liked that you weren't too fighty, but clarified questions you weren't sure of. Nice job sticking to your story that the knife looks like Bowman's.	I may have misheard but the "what was the last incident?" was a bit vague. I also don't know where this line of questioning is going. Oh okay, Poole is involved. Still, how does this relate to the crime at hand? Glad you're laying the foundation about the knife -- I was wondering how this witness knew that it was Bowman's knife.	I thought the first objection was entirely correct. But it was for the part where the witness guessed what Poole was doing with those bands -- not the part where they say Poole was shady. Edit: I guess this isn't something you are disagreeing with, so I understand why you didn't argue with this.\r\n\r\nGood pauses, and good witness control -- got him to admit that he can't be sure it's Bowman's knife.	8	5	8	5	Mic is a little fuzzy, obviously not scoring for that, just might miss some of your testimony. I like the character immediately. Likable. Hand gestures are a tad bit distracting. Good job getting a bit angry at Bowman breaking the rules.	Immediately a bit less confident on cross. Very different character on cross. Looked down a lot. I think the losing money in July of 2020 thing was pretty straightforward, you seemed to try to dodge answering that, I'm not sure why. Don't ask the attorney to come forward with your affidavit. Sounds like you're asking for a refresher? Unclear what is going on at all. Cutting off the attorney a bit. Oh, I think there are wifi issues at play.	Good confidence, good tone on your questions. The two of you were very conversational. You look like you're actually listening to the answers. The flow of the direct was very smooth. This witness is the first time that it's been clear to me exactly why the wristbands are important. Maybe I'm just slow, but well done. Good response on the hearsay objection.	I think there were a few missed objections, that Bowman knew how to operate the ride. "I bet she knew everything" is a lot for this witness to say.\r\n\r\nInitially: Good confidence on cross, seemed in control. Good rephrasing on your question about more people being interested -- made the witness sound a little ridiculous. Don't reference affidavit in the cross, just ask about the facts in it.\r\n\r\nYou got lost in it, should've maintained witness control instead of objecting non-responsive. If you are to impeach, you have to do more to show that this is the witness's affidavit. Whoa, you brought up the affidavit but didn't read from it, not sure what is going on.\r\n\r\nThese questions are getting very confusing. So I didn't sustain the relevance objection, but you sort of just ended that pocket without showing very much. After sustaining the speculation objection, it would've been good to have some follow up so you don't end on the objection.	7	7	9	4	Very professional. Seems a little disinterested, could probably be a bit more excited. Good use of exhibits, especially the one with the actual bracelets. I wish I could've seen this sooner.\r\n\r\nThe answer regarding what happened on the day of the robbery was veeeery long. Could've been broken up.	Seemed nervous at times. You were given an opportunity to explain your investigation with an open ended question, but it wasn't made super clear. You did better at explaining from there on out. I would be confused if I were in your shoes too -- a lot of open ended questions.	Good for responding after I ruled. Defense did make it sound like the method was necessary to tender the expert, thanks for clarifying, and I apologize for getting it wrong. \r\n\r\nGood job generally being clear on objections, and in your questioning. I don't know if it's necessary to go back over the employee manual. We've already seen it, I don't know how much more this witness shows us. Keep track of what's already been admitted. Probably right about the compound question objection, but it's not a super important point.	When I was asking you about the expert tendering thing, it seemed you were not fully paying attention, but it could have been wifi issues. No objection to saying that Bowman knew about the ticket scheme? I think that's certainly insufficient foundation. Okay you did object -- although it was definitely untimely. But yes, she could not say\r\n\r\n"That's good" in response to a witness answer is very odd. Weird asking an open ended question on cross. At some point, you sort of testified that there were two causes to the general trend with the tickets. Control could have been more effective. A lot of open ended questions. I counted at least 4.\r\n\r\nNot sure why defense cross is ending on someone thinking it was Bowman's knife.	5	5	6	7	Not sure what the character is. More tonal variation would be nice during the exciting parts of the direct.	Lost confidence, some "ums" here and there. Seemed unsure of yourself. Didn't fight on anything -- not sure if you could've, but you caved on facts that aren't great for defense.	Looked at times disengaged from the witness's testimony. Some closed ended questions, I would've sustained a leading objection. I'm not sure about ended where you did.	Pretty concise questions. Flow of the questions was nice, decent witness control.	8	6	7	8	You seemed very realistic, and believable. Good job portraying a sympathetic defendant. Good job distancing yourself from Poole, and making it seem suspicious that he would take the booth job instead of operating a ride. I did not realize that this witness would admit to knowing about the scheme with the bracelets. Interesting that you spend this much time on the bracelets. I thought more of this direct would be spent on the day of the robbery. Whoa, I didn't realize the shot was fired into the active ride. This is a p plausible explanation of why you would shut down the ride.	Good job staying credible. Some of the facts weren't in your favor, but you just don't seem like a suspicious person. You can take some of these questions as an opportunity to explain your side of the story.	Good foundational questions. I like the attempt to react to the witness's answers. It was a bit stunted at times, but I appreciate trying to make it more conversational. Nice job just letting the witness shine, I felt like I was listening to a story.	Be careful with your facial expressions in reacting to their direct. No need for open ended questions on cross. Good flow of questions generally, makes Bowman seem closer to Poole again. (Have I been misspelling Poole this whole time by the way?) Make sure you know which exhibits have already been entered. Good use of the photo... Makes it seem difficult to accidentally turn on blackout mode.	7	6	5	9	Pretty likeable, more interested than some of the other witnesses in today's case. since you're going last, that's an important thing to do. At times you talked kind of fast -- slowing down will make it easer to digest the information.	You let the attorney take control of this cross, feel free to fight back more. Throughout the cross, you got more confident. You made your experience in the park clear.	Listen carefully to opposing counsel's objection -- you made a hearsay response to a 403 objection. Whenever you have the time, familiarize yourself better with character evidence. In a lot of the cases, you weren't violating any rules, but the argument you made didn't explain why.	Good job switching up your objection based on D counsel's response. Technically I should have overruled because there's an objection for defendant character traits, but I sustained since that argument wasn't made. You're sort of right with the "it was weird" relevance objection. But my main feedback for you is to search for objections that affect the case. In this case, you can just let it go.\r\n\r\nGreat confidence, and very concise questions. Good tone and transitional signposts. "This is an invasion of privacy" is maybe one question too far. "I take this as a yes to my question that this was an invasion of privacy" <- this is too much of a statement. You witness controlled her fine, you didn't need to go back to that initial phrasing. Good control into getting the witness say that they're hoping something comes out of this trial.	9	I don't know about the choice to screen-share from the very beginning of your closing, just because it's distracting from what you're saying. Good starting story of what the prosecution's theory is. I like the energy, you sound passionate. However, having more tonal variation would be a good things. That way the highs feel higher and the lows feel lower.\r\n\r\nThe way you explain the burden sort of backfires -- you make it sound like the prosecution has to be perfect. That's true, but as the prosecution, you don't want to make it sound that way. Also are you leaving the screenshare up the whole time? Probably not necessary.\r\n\r\nGreat job bringing up things that happened in the case. Referencing the other side's witness is good. Sophistry? That's extreme lol, but I get what you're saying.	6	I don't understand "for you a thousand times." When I heard it in opening, I assumed it would be a line that came out during trial, but I don't remember hearing it. Maybe it was there and I missed it, but it should've been a bigger deal if it is the theme.\r\n\r\nWhen you were explaining the burden, it sounded like you were not super confident. I think the story that you give matches the one given in opening, and it's very clear.\r\n\r\nThe content itself of the closing is solid -- I think it's just nerves that affected the delivery of it. You addressed a lot of different parts of the case, which was well done. I think it was a bit longer than it needed to be.	42	129	122	126	29	120	27	124	121	31	t
50	7	- only 3min left after the story intro, maybe speed up a bit at the beginning  (~1min for story intro);\r\n- a theme throughout the speech, but its kinda not crystal clear as to the story, need to work on the clarity	8	- nice pace of the "possibility" speech, make it your theme and the first sentence of your speech;\r\n- engaging speech\r\n- tied it well with the burden of proof and possibilities	8	7	7	8	- nice character\r\n- bowman is a he, right?	- good responses during cross\r\n- but don't always avoid tough questions, try to give out some info but still maintain your character and help your side	- nice response to objection	- so you asked a lot about Longstreet and when the witness finally answered, you moved on to ask about bowman? so whats the point \r\n- affidavit is hearsay, can't refer to a certain line unless you go through the impeachment procedure\r\n- speculation is not related to whether you have laid the foundation\r\n- maybe give us a bit context as to who longstreet and hayley since they were not mentioned in the direct\r\n- if you ask a question, stick to it	8	8	7	8	- nice character	- nice response to tough questions and fair answers	- nice response to objection\r\n- after you confirmed with Longstreet about her knowledge on the control panel, you should emphasize that she knows bowman used the lever that caused the blackout	- hearsay objection missed? about haley, before the one about kimball\r\n- in the lack of foundation, don't mention about whether this info appeared in the case file, just ask based on the facts\r\n-	7	7	9	7	- breaking gender stereotypes, anti-money laundering\r\n- what do you mean by you don't look professional? kinda unnecessary to your character	- yes, but I wasn't the only one - that was a good one	- nice pace and work with your witness\r\n- good response and objections	- financial crimes ≠ criminal case?\r\n- if you are confident that you can disqualify the witness, you are free to do so via a voir dire in your cross, don't waste your time on the objection battle esp when the judge already qualifies the expert witness\r\n- you should follow up on your objection to refresh the judge's mind because the judge won't always stay alert, so saying no response is kinda like giving up on your objection\r\n- dont' skip an important question, just rephrase it or enter the exhibit into the evidence	7	6	7	9	- why you know whether a wristband is fake or not? did you lay any foundation or did I miss that?	- don't fight so hard on all questions\r\n- you should think of other fun stuff to interpret things you overheard that fits your character as a limo driver - like you heard a lot about it and ppl just bluffing all the time etc	- don't talk to your opposing counsel, direct your response to the judge\r\n- excited utterance - did you should that's a circumstance that it is unlikely to be a premeditated falsehood - immediate and angry doesn't suffice the stress condition	- good argument against the excited utterance\r\n- nice follow-up on the phone call at your cross, undermining the credibility of the testimony	7	7	7	7	- maybe add a bit more to your character		- good questions but the witness does not stand out so think harder on the character	- good questions and nice focus	7	7	7	10		- try to simplify your answer and talk to the camera\r\n- also try to think of things to explain that makes suspicious things look okay like why you only save Pole's number in your phone\r\n- just say yes when its a yes, don't need to think for so long or maybe\r\n- also accident regarding the lever, why? is there a reason, currently not convincing	- don't skip questions and give up on objections, esp the imp ones, judges will give you scores for trying\r\n- the "calm-down" scene is unnecessary unless you are trying to establish him under some kind of post-event trauma	- nice intro about money and stealing, concise and straightforward\r\n-	8	rebuttal\r\n- try to find one focus and keep it short and strong	7	- you talked about direct connection, but you should talk about possibilities aka reasonable doubts, and use the prosecution's own words by the end of their speech regarding empirical evidence that they have failed to provide so that failed their burden of proof - to summarize, the opening sentence is important and you should organize it well\r\n- also by now you should not say there could be a possibility, you should connect what your witnesses said that directly/indirectly indicates the possibility - connect with your latter discussion "you heard from xxx"	14	100	76	203	210	78	83	80	79	207	t
45	7	You do need to pace the opening a bit, with pauses to emphasize the specific counts/themes.\r\nI don't quite see how the bracelets are connected to the motive/crime of the defendant in the opening.\r\nMy suggestion is that you need to break down the counts into different elements which you can prove one by one. (Motive, Knowledge, Intentional Aid, for example)\r\nMaybe a smoother transition from the theme to the story.	5	The theme is way too long or just it was not a theme.\r\nI can see you are reading from the script. You need to 'deliver' the opening, not 'reading' it.\r\nGood mentioning the burden. You need to elaborate on that, what are possible doubts? What are the doubts? What are the elements of the counts you are negating?\r\nYou need to show how the witnesses are related to the counts you are denying.	9	8	8	5	Like the energy.\r\n\r\nThe projection thing, you might need to elaborate. The numbers were shown in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThe jump to Poole was a bit too abrupt. It was the counsel who started talking about 'suspicion' on behalf of the witness.\r\n\r\nThe shift of the motion was somewhat weird. You don't have that dramatic shift just because of a change of topic.	Good maitaining the character (or perhaps a part of it).\r\n\r\nYou do need to make the shift between emotions smoother lol	You don't need to comment the witness answers "I'm sorry", "Terrible".\r\n\r\nNice procedures. The demostratives, I guess, they are purely for the percentages, but they were there for a too short period of time.\r\n\r\nBtw, don't interupt your witness.\r\n\r\nGood LoF objection.	Make you questions land. Questions too long.\r\n\r\nLay foundations.	9	8	8	6	Good signposting and summary of the investigation.\r\n\r\nLike the conclusion part. But some are highly based on maybe speculative inferences. You might need to watch out for possible objections in the future.	Good professional explanations.\r\n\r\nFor some questions, you could let them go. No need for tons of explanations.	Good transitioning and signposting. The connections are great.\r\n\r\nRelevance is low bar anyway.\r\n\r\nLofPK is not a very good objection on cross.	This text message screenshot is highly disputable and speculative. You can also try lack of foundation. \r\n\r\nMake you question lands. Redirect your witness back. Get a definite answer.\r\n\r\nLack of personal knowledge objection. The witness can simply says she doesn't know if this is something she doesn't know.\r\n\r\nRefrain from saying 'Okay', looks like conceding.	8	7	7	7	The impression/imitation was somethwat offensive and distracting.	Good character through. Some unimportant questions don't require a lengthy response.	Refrain from commeting, 'sorry to hear', 'how strange'.\r\n\r\n'Later I found out', LoF.\r\n\r\n'Did you just say', Leading.\r\n\r\n'What was the history', some sort of transition needed from your previous topic.\r\n\r\nThat is not hearsay when the opposing counsel is just asking questions about the knowledge of the witness himself.	Missed objections, see above.\r\n\r\nRedirect the witness back, you need to get a definite answer.\r\n\r\nAnd you need to show the jury where you are heading. The questions are not well organized.	8	7	7	8	I love the acceent.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can have more variation of tones over the course. \r\n\r\nI can see you are still reading from time to time.	Some questions are arguable during the cross for example, 'broke a rule'.\r\n\r\nGood maintaining the character throughout. You do need good explanation for the descrepancies there.	Good story line. Maybe more signposting.\r\n\r\nSorry I missed this, what was the specific point of using the text message?\r\n\r\nThe opposing counsel is testifying.	Clear cut cross. Mark the beginning of your pocket with signposting.\r\n\r\nMake your question land tho, you don't need to hurry to the next if this is a very important answer you are looking for.\r\n\r\nGood redirecting back.\r\n\r\nSome questions could be blown up to make the points.\r\n\r\nYou are getting somewhat faster and faster throughout the cross.\r\n\r\nDon't testify. Those are for the triers of the facts to decide.	6	5	8	9	What's the cap and the pen for? They are a bit distracting.	Some arguments are not necessary at all. You don't fight all the questions. I don't quiet see why you are going to argue so much about the use of scandal.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the stalling and unnecessary repetition/questions.\r\n\r\nIt looks like as if you are not familiar with your affidavit.	Good structure of the direct in general.\r\n\r\nYou need to prep your witness better.\r\n\r\nNice try for the improper character evidence argument.	Some speculation and LoF missed.\r\n\r\nGood control of the witness. I like the decency there. Sharp contrast.\r\n\r\nWell, especially for a witness like this, you need to make your question lands. And also, making your questions shorter and more concise would give zero leeway for the witness to argue with you. I know this is not your fault, but you need to prepare for the worst.	5	5	5	8	You are reading I guess?\r\n\r\nThe accent needs polishing. It sounds Russian to me only periodically.\r\n\r\nBe familiar with your material and understand what you 'should' talk about when accidents/objections happen.	I don't like the stalling. Answer the questions.\r\n\r\nGet familiar with your materials.	Lay more foundation for your witness's story.\r\n\r\nPrepare for the possible objections. You cannot jump from one point to another and this makes it difficult to understand what you are saying.	Good objections!\r\n\r\nI do symphasize with you lmao. But you did need to plan the time wisely.\r\n\r\nYou just don't mention the affidavit.\r\n\r\nDon't show that you are frustrated. Your decency would help to demonstrate the contrast.\r\n\r\nYou don't need the second last question.	7	You don't argue the concession of theft in that way, the jury can still acquit him even if he didn't contest it.\r\n\r\nLike the narrative, but you will need to consider linking facts to elements of the counts. Not just by referring to the jury instruction. \r\n\r\nGood mentioning the 'reasonable' standard. But not just mentioning 'wants you to believe' but also what you recovered in cross examination. And also slow down when necessary.\r\n\r\nThe rebuttal could have more variations and emphasis on the elements.	7	You do need to explain the counts in plain words, but good try bringing them up.\r\n\r\nGood to bring up what you found on cross examinations. But I do believe some of them were not corroborated well or proven clearly in the examinations.\r\n\r\nYou need connections between facts and counts as well.	15	101	160	168	106	163	167	164	107	161	t
81	5	Speak slower when you tell the story. Slow down when you say your theme - otherwise we might not catch your theme. Good storytelling tho. You need to explain the burden of proof. Good job appealing for burden. It'll be great if you can incorporate the witness testimony into your overall storytelling. The three questions would come more effectively if it goes right after the burden section.	7	Very strong start. Good hand gesture. Be careful, though, with using "what if I told you" - it might be argumentative. It appears you are reading off a script, which is a no-no in zoom trial - that will bar you from earning an otherwise top score. Good speed in general, you can speak a little faster in the middle of a sentence, tho, to make it more fluent and easier to understand.  You need variations of tone and speed to show contrast. Four questions: you can make a demo about this. Generally, we have rule of three - when you go above three, it is becoming a little harder to follow. Good job repeating your theme.	6	6	7	8	Good knowledge of the material. It appears you are reading off a script. Good job having a curious tone when you talked about how you found the problem.	Good job being mostly agreeable on cross. You sound a little unconfident, though.	You can speak a little louder - even though it's on zoom, it is still a little difficult to hear you clearly. Good flow of the direct, you let the witness tell the story. I feel you could have a little more interactions with the witness - the chemistry feels a little weak.\r\n\r\n“No one saw it when Poole threaten you" might be a good place to object speculation.	The testimony about how the witness found the problem is borderline improper opinion. I would at least raise one objection per direct to break flow.\r\n\r\nNice and slow in asking question. Good job focusing on Longstreet in your question, it contributes to your case theory. Reask the question after the objection is overruled.	5	7	7	9	Your camera is way too high - I can only see part of your face. Good knowledge of the material. Good tone. You appear to be reading off a script. The breakdown of the park revenue is complicated and includes a lot of numbers, I would make a demo on this to help jury follow your testimony.	You appear more spontaneous on cross, perhaps because you are no longer reading off a script.	Good, natural tone while inquiring the witness. When you screen share, make sure you use the full screen. Good job following procedure in entering evidence. The answer about the park revenue is way too long. I would break down the question more. Narrative doesn't really have a time limit lol. Good job ending your direct on the most dramatic moment.	When you want to see the screen clearly, you are not really raising an objection. I would phrase it more as a "point of order" instead of an "objection", as it makes you more likable as an advocate.\r\n\r\nAppropriate demeanor for cross. Good signposting. Good hand gesture. Witness control comes in level - you can be more soft at the start of the cross, and move to more aggressive as the witness continues to fight. Nice and short cross.	7	7	6	6	Love the passion - it tends to make you more likable. I would try to come up with some kind of back story to make you sound more like a real person. I wouldn't appear so irritated when you talk about how Bowman asks for a raise - it makes you appear mean in the eyes of the jury.	You maintained your credibility generally well on cross. You are over explaining on some minor questions, though.	Good job guiding the witness. Your witness is very passionate, you need to match your tone and voice to her energy. Take dramatic pauses after the witness gives a damning answer. The ending is a little underwhelming.\r\n\r\nI would object badgering the witness if counsel interrupts the witness. You eventually made the objection but it's a little late.	Now I heard the relationship between Longstreet and Kimball twice in the cross, I expect that to be part of your theory and I think it would be best if you mention that in your opening statement. I wouldn't directly interrupt the witness, judges hate multiple people talking all at once at Zoom.  If you have to interrupt her, object nonresponsive.	8	9	8	7	Love your passion as a witness. I wouldn't use a virtual background though - it seems fake in my opinion - I would try to setup your room to fit your character. The answer about amusement park is too long, break it down.	Just say no to the "bias" question. You picked your battles on cross, good job! Your credibility is generally well-maintained.	Good, curious inquiry tone. You can be a little more friendly in your demeanor (aka smile) for a likable character witness. Good job letting the witness tell the story. I might have missed it, but I don't think you laid foundation of this witness' knowledge of Bowman. Good response to opposing counsel's lack of personal knowledge objection, but try to be more fluent your witness. Good argument for hearsay, but I don't think the law is on your side.\r\n\r\nGood lack of personal knowledge objection. I think you could have objected speculation to the question about Poole escaping security.	"She appears to be distracted" - speculation? Be more confident when you object. Good hearsay argument. \r\n\r\n"This would cause your prejudice" is one question too far. I would make sure the witness can only answer yes to your question, otherwise you need to change the question so that you can lock the witness down.	8	6	6	9	Your emotion is appropriate as the defendant. You brought a lot of sympathy. You need to rearrange your camera angle so you are in the middle of the camera view. You could be more emotional when you talk about how you accidentally hit the wrong button.	You are overexplaining in some foundational questions. Pick your battle. If you fight too much, it tends to diminish your credibility. You also sound confused on some questions. Be confident - you know your material.	Good flow. Good, natural tone. Good job coming back after the lopk objection. Be more confident when you respond to hearsay, the law is on your side. Good storytelling in general. Don't end on an objection, just ask another question before you sit down.\r\n\r\nI would object counsel testifying when she makes a comment to the witness, for example, "amazing". You eventually objected, but it is a little untimely.	Good lack of personal knowledge objection. A verbal act is not hearsay unless the statement has TRUTH VALUE (aka, the statement can be true or false). Very good argument on lack of personal knowledge for park employees' attitudes. Good 403 objection.\r\n\r\nGood witness control. Some of your questions are quite long, break it down. The shorter your questions are, the easier you can control the witness. You can use your tone to sound more ridiculous when you point out how absurd the defendant's story is. You can't just say "that's a yes to my question" - you need to actually ask a question. Given D is pleading guilty to theft by deception, I wouldn't focus that much on stealing money; I would focus on what she did on the night in question.	7	6	7	5	Love your deliberate tone and speed. Very likable. It appears you are reading from your script tho. Though I don't have a problem with this, some judges might be annoyed that you kept your hat on. Also I wouldn't use virtual background - you look more like a real person when you are using real background.	Your character dropped a bit on cross.	Good inquiry tone when asking your questions. I would take a little longer pause after the witness gives his response so you give the jury some time to process. If State didn't introduce the fake bracelets into evidence, I'm not sure why you need to introduce yourself - you don't have the burden of script. I think it is stipulate that Exhibit 9 is true and accurate copy of what occurred in the park. I like the ending of your direct. Good redirect questions.	You were not called out by Defense counsel, but I think it is stipulate that Exhibit 9 is a fair accurate representation of the bracelets being used in the park, so your objection sounds very bad-faith.\r\n\r\nIt appears you are reading off a script. You will be more spontaneous if you are not reading. A quick response to the 404 objection is that it goes to the bias and credibility of this witness.	6	Good storytelling. You need to slow down more. Good job explaining your burden of proof, but I think you could have simplified it a little further to help the jury understand. It appears you are reading off a script. Good summary of the evidence - it is a little dry though. Try to add more arguments (e.g., D asks you to believe... but the evidence shows ...), or analogy. "Preponderance" is a mischaracterization of the burden of proof. You have to show beyond a reasonable doubt.	8	Good tone and speed at the start of the direct. Good call back to your questions at the start of the trial. You could have more variation in tone and speed; for example, when you talk about how the defendant accidentally touched the wrong lever, you can sound more emergent and speed up. Good summation of evidence, but it is a little dry.	21	37	178	27	182	175	177	176	33	180	t
40	7	Good discussion of elements.  Presentation of characters (Whit Bowman, police officer) in the narrative should be more direct.  You are running out of time as you go over the narrative a second time to intro the witnesses.  Not sure you needed the demonstrative -- you want us to focus on you, and on little else.	6	You need to tell us your version of the narrative much sooner.  Intro Whit Bowman sooner, and tell us the truth from her eyes.  Otherwise, all we are left with is a series of conclusions you want us to draw, without facts to look for that will lead to those conclusions.	7	6	7	7	Decent character, although it slips at times, esp. when you get into deeper explanations, e.g., black-out mode.	Bad look on impeachment - your denial and subsequent acknowledgement of Cameron Poole's guilt (in your mind) undermines your credibility.  I would not deny that fact.	I don't see the relevance of the first line of questioning about ongoing financial theft.  In general, you also need to signal to the jury why your lines of questioning matter (i.e., signposting).\r\nHearsay was not clearly handled -- if you don't want that fact to be in, have your witness deny it, or say "that's what I heard Kimball say, but I don't know if that's true" -- that makes the evidence instantly unreliable to the Court.	I would object to the relevance of the first line of questioning.  Let's get the Prosecution to demonstrate their logic before permitting these facts onto the record.\r\nRocking to and fro is very distracting.  \r\nImpeachment dragged on a bit.  Your question needs to be more tightly tied to the phrasing, e.g. "you had clear proof that ...".  But it was effective.	6	6	5	9	You need to be better coordinated with your counsel, so you can put out the facts he's seeking even when he has to change his questions during the round.\r\nAlso, need to create a bit more character -- often, a uniform, a badge, or a very serious attitude will suffice for a cop.	Were unable to squirm out of a tough, tough CX.  Need to find a way to push back.	It is unclear whether you are offering Kimball as an expert.  If you are, then your witness must tell us what specialized knowledge she used -- what makes her an expert.\r\nYou need a better grasp of procedure -- show your witness the exhibit first, before moving to enter evidence.  And ENTER YOUR EVIDENCE!! (E.g., Exh. 5).	Fumbled with structure of the 702 objection, but your perseverance and use of Mississippi BBQ was effective.  Your objection should be "improper expert opinion".  That allows you to explain that the witness has no specialized training or knowledge that qualifies her to be an expert -- that makes her any better at detecting financial fraud that the average math-knowing adult.\r\nExcellent instincts on objections -- that's the hardest part of this job, and you were solid!\r\nText message (Exhibit 5) was never entered!  You should have objected to that being testified to.\r\nFinally - excellent CX.  Forceful; did not let the witness disagree or narrate; kept it tight and focused.  Good job!	7	8	7	6	Competent, credible portrayal.  Good work tossing in the fact that you did not have permission to look through the locker.	Good work right away on CX, clarifying how well you knew Whit Bowman.  And really well done on the difference between switching bracelets and taking $$!	Good foundation on expert's qualifications.  No need to move to qualify, laying the foundation is enough.  Need to improve evidence procedure - enter the evidence before eliciting testimony on it!  Ran out of time owing to the time expended on Witness 2.	Good, hard-hitting questions, but you were unable to pin the witness down.	8	9	7	8	Strong character portrayal, especially forceful denial of allegations, as well as mannerisms suggesting that you were not hurting for money.  Maybe a little too loud near the end.	Seemed like you confused opposing counsel, and certainly disagreed with him a lot, while staying polite.  Always a good outcome!	Great use of party-witness exception!  Shorten your questions when your witness is on a roll - Why?  What happened next?  And so on.\r\nGood evidentiary procedure.	Object!!  The witness brought in hearsay, speculated, and testified beyond the scope of her personal knowledge.   All in the first 5-6 questions.\r\nWhat happened with the "stealing $$$ in 2012" line of questioning?\r\nGood back-and-forth with a feisty and self-assured witness.  And good tone/expression to dramatize your questions!\r\nFinal set of questions got twisted up and confusing.\r\n"Why is it important to be honest?" -- That's an argumentative question!  Should have been objected to!\r\n"Are you sure?" - Unnecessary.	8	9	8	6	Fun character, a little hard to hear.  But definitely a charismatic performance!	Making me laugh every time the camera switches back to you.  Super!	Well-structured direct.  Good framework and organization, with good signposts and segues.  And drew no objections - always a plus!	Watch out for compound questions, and phrasing like "what I would call ...".\r\nMore composed on cross, but not sure you landed any blows on the witness's direct testimony.	8	8	8	0	Amusing character, and good facial expressions.	Amusing start, holding up the QR code.	Clear and effective structure.  Good closing set of questions!  Cameron Poole, Cameron Poole, Cameron Poole ... very effective answers elicited.\r\nWatch out for compound questions.	No score awarded as there was no CX (connection issues prevented counsel from conducting CX).	6	Good job under the circumstances, but the record in support of Prosecution was pretty thin.  A rebuttal would have helped.	9	Great start, narrowing Whit Bowman's involvement to just cracking open a door.  Good description of speculation vs. facts, and good summary of all the deficiencies in Prosecution's case.	27	133	236	194	57	59	58	60	56	197	t

75	7	PRETRIAL: (not scored)\r\n- Nothing in pretrial should be directed at the jury.\r\n- Typically people invoke 603 and 615 together. \r\n\r\nOPENING:\r\nShe planned, so she pushed. - SAY THIS WITH CONVICTION! \r\nEven on Zoom, eye contact is very important -> try looking directly into the camera, if you look at yourself on screen, it looks like you're reading. \r\nGreat job explaining the law, and making the distinction between the robber and an accomplice.\r\nTry to shift your tone more between the story part (explaining what happened) and the law pocket (demo). You want to be more intense/dramatic at the beginning, and more educational and casual while explaining the law. These are people who have never been in a courtroom and have no clue what's going on, walk them through it very slowly and very simply. \r\nGood structure, sorting out the counts into simple facts is helpful. \r\nSpice up the demo a little bit, black and white is not very visually interesting.	5	PRETRIAL: (not scored)\r\n- figure out audio issues beforehand\r\n- challenge their description of the indictment, they started arguing their case in pretrial, that isn't ok. \r\n\r\nOPENING:\r\nCoincidences and accidents don't make up the logic line. \r\nTry and maintain a more professional tone. Speak slower, louder and more calmly. \r\nEven on Zoom, eye contact is very important -> try looking directly into the camera, if you look around the room, it looks like you're more nervous. \r\nDo not cite case law in your opening, jury members have never been in court, they will have no idea what the case law is or what it means. You can potentially make the same argument without citing the specific wording and naming the law, but talk to your coaches about how to do this. \r\nIn an opening statements, you cannot state facts that are not on the record yet. Everything should be something that you proffer. Make sure you're starting your sentences with "You will hear" "You will learn" "Today, the evidence will show." \r\nYour entire opening is directed at the jury, not the judge. Make sure it's "members of the jury" not "your honor"	7	7	7	3	SLOWWW DOWN! You had great answers, I just struggled to catch everything you were saying.\r\n\r\nTough direct, lots of objections, try and keep your energy and professionalism up throughout. You did well.	Great job sticking to "I don't know." for the confusing questions.\r\nTry to keep the same demeanor and energy on cross. You seemed a bit less excited and animated.\r\n\r\nGood job working through tech issues.	702 Argument\r\nIn Midlands "entering an expert" isn't something I've seen before. I would recommend just laying 702a-d and then eliciting a conclusion. \r\n\r\n703\r\n- great job connecting the statement to her expertise, but make your arguments shorter. \r\n- CITE MY PREVIOUS RULINGS! I ruled in your favor on hearsay before, you can use that to say "you ruled in my favor before, this is the same situation, you can rule in my favor again"\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy 804b, you have to tell me why the statements in those texts specifically are against Poole's interest. The text messages are very vague, they don't prove that on their own. \r\n\r\nDo a point of order if the crossing attorney interrupts the witness.	Hearsay Arguments - This fact that she was hired doesn't hurt your case inherently, so I probably would not object to it. \r\nLeading - If it didn't work the first time, it wasn't going to work the second time. Leading questions presuppose an answer, or they have the answer already in the question. For example, "You spoke to all of the witnesses in this case, right?" would be a leading question. "Did you speak to all of the witnesses?" is NOT leading because it does not presume that the detective did or did not speak to anyone. \r\n\r\nAll of the statements - She is an expert, under 703, if they can connect hearsay statements to her conclusions, they CAN use hearsay on their direct exam. Also, there are numerous exceptions. Just because something is HS, does not automatically make it inadmissible. \r\n\r\nUltimate Issue is applied very sparingly. \r\n\r\nYou were very trigger happy with objections, aim to make one, maybe two on a direct. Also, if a judge offers a ruling, accept and move on. \r\n\r\nOne thing that you could have objected to was "bowman lied" - that is pure speculation. They have no way of knowing that she intended to lie, and that phrasing forces the witness to enter Bowman's mindset. \r\n\r\nDon't thank the witness.\r\n\r\nDO NOT interrupt a witness. It comes across as very condescending and aggressive. \r\n\r\nIf you want to impeach the witness, fully impeach the witness. Go through the proper procedure. You cannot read a section of their affidavit, or accuse them of lying on the stand without following that procedure. You have to demonstrate a direct contradiction clearly.\r\n\r\nGood job working through tech issues.\r\n\r\nCrosses should only have leading questions.	8	8	7	5	The old man is funny! Great job with the voice. \r\nAlthough, I will say that the gold rush was a long time ago, so maybe choose a historical event a little bit more.\r\n\r\n"now that I think about it, there was something strange" -> not a natural thing someone would say, try and find a different transition to introduce whit bowman being there. \r\n\r\ndrinking out of the cup is funny, but find a better time for it\r\n\r\nif you get asked the same question twice, find a different way to word your answer the second time, it doesn't sound natural for you to repeat the same answer again.	Good job deflecting, I thought you handled yourself very well. \r\n\r\nDon't assume what a question is implying. If your character would be confused, act confused. Even though you might know what the other side will ask, your character has no idea what's coming on cross.\r\n\r\nGood job handling the impeachment and clarifying. I don't think it landed.	Great use of the exhibit! \r\n\r\nCommands have no truth value was a good argument\r\n\r\nRelevance is an extremely low bar, most things that are somewhat related to the people in the case will be considered relevant.\r\n\r\nIf there is no clear contradiction after someone impeaches your witness, you can object hearsay. That is an improper impeachment.	Narrative comes across as very aggressive on a character witness. He's just introducing himself to the jury.\r\n\r\nBe on screen during their direct. \r\n\r\n"How did cameron know where whit bowman was?" - that is a lack of personal knowledge. He would have to be Cameron to assert that Cameron knew anything. \r\n\r\nNice guy question does not affect your case. \r\n\r\nCrosses should ONLY have leading questions.\r\n\r\nThere was no clear contradiction, I don't think you should have impeached him. Impeachments are reserved for blatant misstatements.	8	7	8	6	You speak really clearly and slowly, great job! \r\n\r\nI hear a lot of variation in your voice, great job!	Good job handling an aggressive crosser. Try not to get defensive/explain too much. If they're pushing you, you need to let it roll off your back a bit more.	Great job citing 803.2. \r\n\r\nGood job objecting hearsay, solid.	Do not laugh during their objection arguments, it's very disrespectful.\r\n\r\nJust because a statement is made, does not automatically make it hearsay. Try to have a response to the exception itself. You can explain to the judge why a statement doesn't fall under an exception.\r\n\r\nQuestions and commands have no truth value, they are not hearsay. \r\n\r\nDo not ever interrupt the witness, it is very aggressive.\r\n\r\nTry to keep your composure, becoming aggravated makes you look less professional.  \r\n\r\nYes or no control was good! \r\n\r\nYou need to make sure that you lay foundation that the witness recognizes the affidavit and screenshare the affidavit so that they can see it.	7	6	7	8	Speak slower! I think you had great answers, but I think you were speaking too fast at some points. \r\n\r\nThe tears were a bit over the top, it doesn't feel authentic if you need a tissue or if your attorney has to tell you to calm down. Think about what a victim in court would actually act like.	You held up well! Try not to explain too much.	Look at the screen, even if you're in the same room as your witness.	If it's a record of their revenue, I think that pretty clearly is a business record, I wouldn't have objected. \r\n\r\nGood points, you articulated them well, I thought the cross was solid. \r\n\r\nAlso, if we're hitting all loss better if you don't object.	6	6	7	7	Holding the camera the entire time feels unnatural, you can hold it up.\r\nSpeak slower and louder!	Truth response was good! \r\n\r\nPretty neutral on cross, I think you did a good job deflecting.	Commands have no truth value! "Mind your own business" has no truth value. It's not hearsay.	It seems a bit disingenuous to object to a command when you made the argument that commands don't have truth value, I only sustained "mind your own business" because he did not have a response. \r\n\r\n"What do you think of Bowman" is a character evidence objection for sure.\r\n\r\nGood control - "I'm not asking about what you want."	7	7	7	9	Good, professional demeanor. \r\n\r\nGood job adjusting to objection rulings.	Honestly, I think you could've offered more explanations. Don't let the crossing attorney get into a rhythm of making you say yeses and nos. \r\n\r\nTears felt a little out of place. I think you can show that you regret it without actually crying. \r\n\r\nDon't say you'd delete incriminating messages! There are no incriminating messages if you believe you're innocent.	Try and make your questions more specific - "what happened next?" is very vague. \r\n\r\nDO NOT tell your witness answers during the cross. It is very clear when you're speaking to each other on Zoom.\r\n\r\nDon't laugh during your witnesses cross. Also, you cannot use an emotional breakdown from your own witness as grounds for badgering.	It is quite disingenuous to object to something you entered into evidence earlier, if something is in evidence in an exhibit, it's technically not an out of court statement anymore. \r\n\r\nIf you're going to  come out swinging with "you're a thief" you have to SELL IT! Be confident, be a little snarky. This is the defendant, you have the ability to be a bit more assertive. (not aggressive, just confident)\r\n\r\nGreat, great control and well done pointing out the contradictions within the witnesses answers. Super responsive. The cross built up really well, and your pockets were well structured. Really really well done.\r\n\r\n"Messages that could land you in jail" - step too far, but good job rephrasing.  \r\n\r\nSmart move to use Kimball's testimony for contradiction.\r\n\r\nI will say, the reason the cross isn't a 10 is that it was just too long, you hit the sweet spot, made her look pretty shady, but then you kept going. On a defendant, I would say do 3 pockets, maybe 7-10 SHORT questions each and get out fast. For any other cross, do 2 pockets. Short and sweet.	8	Your theme got a bit lost. I would open your statement with it.\r\n\r\nGreat job explaining reasonable doubt! \r\n\r\nGood responsiveness, both to what happened on defendant cx and the defense's theme. \r\n\r\nGreat job recalling to the moment.\r\n\r\nI thought your closing was great, I would just ask that you add more volume and pitch variation. Find moments to be quiet, angry, indignant, didactic, etc. I think the next level for you is finding moments to vary it up.	6	Being able to see your paper makes you seem unprepared. \r\n\r\nStand for your closing.\r\n\r\nStart with your theme. And make sure you explain the law in a casual way that the jury can understand. It's important to talk to the jury like they're normal people. Sometimes reading straight from the indictment, penal code, etc. can be overwhelming for jury members who are unfamiliar with the law. \r\n\r\nThe defendant is your witness, make sure you get the pronouns correct!	20	122	148	150	149	188	151	152	153	186	t
115	6	Theme: "They came for the money, they came for the lives"\r\nTry to stay away from argumentative phrases like "Pool is a bad person"\r\nFor Opening Statements try to frame your narrative as something the juror will hear\r\nI like the demo - it helps layout your elements really well - maybe consider taking a few of the words off so that the jury has less to look at\r\nDid Whit Bowman participate in the robbery, did they pull the lever intentionally?\r\nGood job outlining the witness testimony\r\nFor your opening, it sounds more like a closing argument, try framing more of the info as stuff we will hear\r\nYou theme should be more integrated in your statement	8	Theme: A flawed investigation and a false accusation.\r\nYour opening narrative is really strong focusing on the unconscious body.\r\nYour rhetoric is a little too aggressive for an opening statement.\r\nI like how you didn't come right out and say your theme, you let the narrative  build up to your theme, very strong.\r\nGood description of the burden\r\nThe rhetoric of this speech is more of a closing, but it is structured very well as an opening.\r\nExcellent description of the witness testimony.\r\nWe have to separate tragedy from culpability - Strong line	7	8	6	8	I like the line about your family of cops\r\nThree C method\r\nCrime Scene Investigation, Robbery, Financial Crime\r\nThe demo is very nice, but maybe make it a bit bigger for the jury. \r\nTo make this direct a little more natural, try making some of the answers shorter so that the questioning period is a little more back and forth rather than just the witness talking for a while.\r\nYou should probably enter exhibit 5 if you are going to put it up on the screen, unless it is pre-admitted.	Make sure to know what is in your affidavit, because you were very close to getting impeached.\r\n\r\nI like how you acted like you were trying to remember the testimony, lended to your credibility.	Good job maintaining your cool after a few objections to the experts qualifications.\r\nFor exhibits, to make things a little more natural, try to refer to the exhibits by their title rather than their number.\r\nGood job letting the witness shine\r\nGood signposting with "I just want to make it clear for the members of the jury.	Good objection - shows you are paying attention to the trial.\r\n"Where do you think the numbers in 2020 go wrong" - Lack of foundation objection missed, we have established that the 2020 numbers are unusual but not necessarily wrong.\r\nYour 702 objection about the reliable application of the experts methods would have been very well received it had been placed when the expert was offered. I overruled because you already submitted that P had met the preponderance standard when you didn't object the expert offering.\r\nGood Hearsay objection and shift to 702 Defense\r\n\r\n"And it was at that point that you knew you had to hold someone accountable" - Great Question\r\nThis witness is really hard to hear, so I am not gonna note anything about like your tone or aggression because you kinda have to be loud and asking for yes or no's because I am a little unsure of what she is saying.\r\nGood job getting a yes or no from the witness.\r\n\r\nI like how short your questions are, it makes for a really short snappy cross.\r\n\r\nTry to not give like short responses like "ok" when the witness disagrees with you.\r\n\r\nOk you are getting a little condescending to the witness when she just didn't understand your question.	9	5	8	9	oh i LOVE this character.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen the like "4th wall break" on zoom, but I really liked it.\r\n\r\nYou are a really believable witness, i loved that you came on with sun glasses. \r\n\r\nOk you have to remember that someone died in this trial so saying that a scream interrupted your conversation is a little insensitive.	On cross, don't ask the attorney questions other than asking them to repeat, it comes off like you are fighting\r\n\r\nLoosen your character a little bit for cross so you arn't fighting so much\r\n\r\nMake sure you know your affidavit because that was a straight impeachment.\r\n\r\nYour score decreased a lot because of the impeachment.	I would have overruled the objection to the finances if your question was not "How was cameron pool stealing from the company".\r\n\r\nReally strong rephrasing of the question, you definitely were asking the witness to give an expert conclusion (which would warrant an objection again), but you did it in a way that the opposing counsel didn't notice, so good on you :)\r\n\r\nGood final 4 questions.	Good Lack of Foundation and improper opinion objection, but they said almost the exact same thing just three questions later, so you probably should have re-raised and it would have been sustained.\r\n\r\nGood cross point about what she does and doesn't know about the robbery.\r\n\r\nIntegrating your theme into the cross about the bias of the cop. Great!\r\n\r\nProbably one of the most streamlined and straightforward impeachments I have ever seen. Really really strong.	7	7	6	8	Why are you drinking Arizona tea hahahah, I think this is a character point, and I kinda like it.\r\n\r\nI like your character it is very laid back, but I think you can cut the arizona tea haha it kinda distracts from the direct.\r\n\r\nIt looks like you are about to run out of time.	I liked your explanation between how the panels are so different.\r\n\r\n"As you can see I am a bartender" - I GET THE ARIZONA TEA NOW\r\n\r\nOk I am confused why you drink from the Arizona Tea before every answer it kinda distracts from your answers which are pretty good.	The question "Have you ever caused any trouble in your work place" is very unusual, so maybe consider restructuring that portion of the direct\r\n\r\nA lot of leading questions as it was clear you guys did not budget a ton of time for this witness.	Good comparison between the two panels. \r\n"is it possible to mix up these two controls" - good question and I am glad that you got a straight answer because that is def reasonable doubt	9	9	8	7	OH THE ACCENT IS EXCELLENT.\r\n"Mama mia" - hahahahah\r\nYour character is staying consistent across the board.\r\nGood job confronting how she didn't know the other person on direct	On cross, don't ask the attorney questions other than asking them to repeat, it comes off like you are fighting\r\n\r\nGood character line with the "Tunnel of Love" stuff.\r\n\r\nGood job maintain character throughout the cross	I really like the sign posting you have.\r\nGood question about someone working with cameron with the fake wrist bands.\r\nThe question and answers are really short and it flows really well	Try not to ask open ended questions on cross.\r\nI am unsure if the attorney was objecting, so don't withdraw your question even if you think it will be objected to.	9	8	8	8	You really seem like you like your job, which lends to your credibility.\r\nGood emotion.\r\nPretty Straight forward Defendant Direct.\r\nWhen you said you didn't recognize the last message, I really believed you, that was excellent acting.\r\nYour acting is excellent.	Good job maintaining a sad demeanor\r\nThis is a really really long cross.	Your demeanor really allows for your witness to shine\r\nLOVED the "if you need a break please let me know"\r\nI thought we were already talking about the robbery? Why was that sign posted twice?	Good job catering to the sadness of the witness\r\nGood job getting you answer\r\nMake sure you take note of what exhibits have been entered into evidence.	10	10	9	8	From South Carolina, USA - I love a good southern accent.\r\nI liked the black and white reference\r\n\r\nthe cow and wifi joke was an excellent extemporaneous joke. Really well done.	Really really great job maintaining character and not fighting too much.\r\n\r\nGood catch on the red thing.	i really like how you guys have focused you case on the panels, it has come up on pretty much every witness you have called. Idk if it is the strongest point, but I like how you guys integrate the point throughout your case and chief\r\n\r\nKinda confused by the Haden information\r\n\r\nOk I am glad you guys are talking about the Detective because I felt like that point of your case kinda trailed off after P case.	Be prepared to respond to those hearsay objections!	8	Your opening narrative is fantastic.\r\nYour rhetoric is also perfectly matched for close\r\nReally strong explanation of complicity \r\nYou should take the emotion and tone shifts that you have on close and apply it to the rest of your content.\r\nBe careful with burden shifting. It is not the Defense's burden to explain how the knife was not Bowman's, it was your burden to prove that it was her's.	9	You should take the emotion and tone shifts that you have on close and apply it to the rest of your content.\r\nHand motions are really strong, especially with the burden.\r\nGood job poking holes, and flipping their theme\r\nTHAT THEME FLIP WAS FANTASTIC.\r\nStrong Timeline\r\nYour closing demo is fantastic	37	160	143	142	57	145	61	147	146	58	t
150	7	A prosecutor should appear calm and steady, so as to avoid looking overzealous.  Your voice is very powerful, however. \r\n\r\nThe attorney in charge of preliminaries said "plaintiff."	7	I like how you are very composed. This works well with the persona you set up for Whit Bowman, which is like this timid person. However, you are clearly reading from a script. It should have been very easy to pretend you are off the script when you are on Zoom, as long as you adjust your camera correctly.	7	6	7	6	I like the persona and voice of this detective. It's very interesting, but it may not appear as the most credible witness if you choose this lay-back persona.	It was weird to say you are "obsessed" with robberies.  You didn't seem familiar with your affidavit.	You didn't answer the judge's question in the objection battle. You seem to have an unusually nice attitude for a prosecutor dealing with a detective. Maintaining some professional distance there is probably helpful.	Good objection to get out the witness report. You weren't very familiar with your script. Saying "fine" when the witness doesn't give you what you want is not helpful. Your impeachment was quite confusing and didn't seem material to your case.	6	6	5	5	You look like you are reading off a script. The acting was a bit exaggerated.	Don't be too fast in answering questions such that your attorney cannot timely object to a question.	Don't engage with anyone off the camera. You were not making eye contact with jurors. You were apparently speaking with the witness which is a big no-no. Objecting to red being distinguishable from green is very odd.	You can't just go after an immigrant mother for saying it's hard to make a living in Midlands. Your voice might be too soft and gentle for a defense attorney going after people falsely accusing his client of a crime. You went way overtime.	6	5	5	7	You looked like you were reading off a script.	You weren't able to effectively dodge certain questions and you hesitated for too long.	Don't ask leading questions, and don't quit when an objection is sustained against you.	If you would just let the statement into the evidence without objection, there is no point to object to hearsay. Form objections like vagueness are usually not appreciated. Otherwise there were some solid objections.	5	6	5	5	You didn't really look like the timid character your opening counsel said you would be. You were trying to talk when you were not directed to do so.	Good response to the question as to why you wouldn't be familiar with Kimball's report. Too bad your attorney left you hanging by yourself on that one.	You often sort of blanked out when the judge was talking to you. You have to immediately respond and cannot leave the judge hanging dry. You missed the important issue regarding Cameron being unavailable.	Don't waste time if you don't have a substantive objection. You lucked out with the Cameron issue, as those objections should have failed if not for the opposing counsel's lack of familiarity with this issue as well. Getting exhibit 3 in from this witness is also not helpful.	7	5	6	5	You were responsive to the judge's instruction on rephrasing.	You shouldn't have given in to the sensational question so easily without a fight.	You need to be more ready for certain easily anticipated objections.	There were a few wrong objections. "Are you a newspaper journalist who writes sensational news" is a very bad way to start a cross. You were having a lot of facial expressions and reactions to a judge's ruling against you.	8	6	6	7	You were in character even when interrupted by objections, which was good.	You were a bit nervous. Your attorney should ask yes or no questions in cross, but you can answer whatever questions they ask.	You missed Poole's unavailability issue in responding to objections.	Don't move on until you get what you want. Otherwise, you were firm and steady.	8	Good body language and facial expressions. I like the change in your tone. However, handling being a prosecutor can always be tricky because you don't want to look overzealous.	7	Interesting way to emphasize the timid persona of Bowman.	36	98	184	68	70	185	71	186	72	73	t
48	7	- Very clear theme--planned, panicked, pushed.\r\n- Good clear storytelling\r\n- "Still in the hospital as we talk today" I like this line; could be delivered with a softer, more emotional tone\r\n- Do not say "probably meet." You WILL meet that burden.\r\n- I like the three questions presentation\r\n- Careful to make sure that hand gestures are above zoom screen\r\n- Great delivery of theme at end of statement\r\n- Statement should have ended closer to the last time said theme\r\n- Good ask at the end\r\n- Needed clearer outline of what witnesses will say	6	- Good emotion with storytelling in the beginning; "a GUNSHOT!"\r\n- Needs more movement to indicate when moving from point to point\r\n- Good outline of witnesses\r\n- "They're trying to prove that with no x, no y, no z" -- good as Defense to try to poke holes\r\n- Do not need metaphors in an opening statement--this statement is already too long, needs to cut lines like this for clarity and conciseness	6	7	9	5	- Good outfit! I like the old lady angle\r\n- Too much "honey" and "sweetheart" -- I would recommend you don't address your attorney this way, it's unrealistic and somewhat demeaning\r\n- Too many narrative answers\r\n- You'd let your five-year-old operate it? This exaggeration is not very believable and lowers your credibility--if it's written into the case materials it's something you'd want to bury not highlight	- Do not call the crossing attorney "sugar" or "darling" -- this comes across as condescending\r\n-  Good job not fighting too much and only picking a few places to fight	- Good job blending into the background and letting the witness guide the questioning\r\n- Some of your witness's answers are too long; could break up with more questions\r\n- GREAT response to lack of foundation\r\n- Good looping "complete 180"\r\n- Could use more tone variation and tone of genuine inquisitiveness	- Good job casting doubt on what this witness actually saw\r\n- Camera angle is unfortunate\r\n- Questions have no tone variation\r\n- Did not respond to direct questions asked during objection argument--try to listen to what the presider is asking you for!\r\n- Good job recovering smoothly after sustained objection	9	9	8	5	- I like the costume and the accent\r\n- Good demeanor for a detective\r\n- SLOW DOWN! You have a great voice for this detective but you're talking too fast\r\n- "Affirmative" -- good use of vocabulary a detective would use but don't overuse the same response; vary it up!\r\n- Good graph!	- Great fights--often not actually contradicting the attorney but just elaborating\r\n- Try not to repeat the same fight more than once\r\n- Good "I don't know" response to last question on cross but it could have been much shorter so that you don't look fazed	- Good, clear line of questioning\r\n- Good structure to direct\r\n- Good reminding the jury of prior testimony, but some intros into questions are way too long\r\n- Good tone of genuine surprise and inquisitiveness\r\n- This direct is too long and it needed more structure\r\n- Too many hand gestures--you don't need to punctuate every word with a hand gesture	- None of this bias pocket is being delivered as though it's damning\r\n- Use more of a skeptical tone/accusatory tone\r\n-  Try not to say "obviously" in an objection argument\r\n- Good job casting doubt on what the detective actually saw during investigation\r\n- Do not let the witness take control of the cross examination\r\n- Direct them back to your question/adjust in a way that does not throw you off (referring to when witness made you screen share when you were not prepared)\r\n- Was hoping the point about the positioning of the maintenance lever and stop buttons would be clarified\r\n- Do not ever say that it will be your last question--it flags the attorney to object	7	4	8	7	- I do not understand what your character is supposed to be\r\n- If you're going to do a big personality for a witness, make sure it is distinct!\r\n- I appreciate the attempts at some jokes like the one about Love Island, but jokes have to be short and snappy\r\n- Some of your answers are narrative/disorganized	- The more you fight/overexplain the more unreliable you look. Try to say less on cross\r\n- Be careful of your expressions! Do not roll eyes and look away from the camera while the attorney is asking you questions\r\n- Answer the question you were asked -- some of your answers were very, very nonresponsive. As a judge listening to this, I'm waiting for you to just answer the question. \r\n- There are very few questions where you gave a yes--you don't have to fight on everything\r\n- The attorney asked a clear question and you said "Ummmm. what's your question again?" I think it's worth rethinking the attitude of this character witness. It comes across as disrespectful at times. If you're confused, try not to be snarky about it.	- Do not ask the witness to state their name and spell their last, especially if this is not something your co-counsel is having their witnesses do\r\n- Good, clear line of questioning\r\n- Great inquisitive tone\r\n- The questions that require short answers are the easiest to understand	- Great job bringing out some terrible facts for this witness\r\n- This witness was incredibly fighty and talkative--you need to control more ("was that a yes?" "directing you back to my question..." "I didn't ask about x, just about y. *repeat question*")\r\n- If you had objected nonresponsive to some of her responses, I would have sustained--some of her responses you never got a yes or no.\r\n- Good tone of conviction\r\n- Good casting doubt on what the witness saw\r\n- Flow of cross doesn't make sense--structure is unclear/isn't advancing case theory\r\n- Good control on same height/same build	7	8	6	7	- You sound animated and interested in what you're saying--good job	- Good flat no to a confusing question\r\n- Good answering yes to what you can say yes to, but try to answer yes the way your character would	Directing attorney: D-att-opening\r\n- Good using simple language for getting witness to identify exhibit\r\n- Some questions are compound/confusing. \r\n- Need more creative transitions then "Let's move on."\r\n- Good relevance response, but could be shorter. When you get an objection to relevance, answer the question of "what fact does this make more or less likely". Be concise.	Crossing attorney: Norah Cen\r\n- I can see when you text on your phone in front of the camera\r\n- Minor thing, but try to elevate your laptop so you can type/text your teammates without anybody seeing!\r\n- Relevance is not the strongest objection to make, especially on direct. If you believe they're wasting their time asking about irrelevant things, why do you care? \r\n- "Improper opinion" -- get more specific. If you had cited speculation or lack of personal knowledge, that would have helped you more here\r\n- I like the legal pad trick to refer to something they said during direct examination! You can add a little more flair, you can say something like "You said this in your earlier conversation so I wrote it down...."\r\n- When you accidentally interrupt the witness, you can just say "Excuse me, were you finished with your response?"\r\n- You don't need to start any questions with "respectfully"	9	7	7	9	- Good, clean background helps to eliminate distractions\r\n- Good emotion when directly confronted with question about crime\r\n- Believable character, seems more like a real person\r\n- GREAT emotion for why ride must be stopped, super believable	- Good short responses\r\n- When you need to flat no add a little confusion to your response like a real witness would\r\n- Responses become monotone\r\n- When you're getting impeached, you can review the document as if you are really trying to see whether or not it is true and authentic. Take your time to slow down the impeachment/make it land less\r\n- Clean impeachment. Your fight makes no sense given what the affidavit says. I might be missing something here, but this looked like a clean impeachment.	- Good confronting charges head on, very clear to understand\r\n- "how did it all begin?" is vague, ask more pointed questions	- Right out the gate with a big question I'd be shocked if the witness said yes to, grabs my attention\r\n- Sets a high bar though--you had better have a line of questioning afterward that DOES make it seem like he lies often\r\n- Good short response to objection on party opp statement--especially when opposing counsel makes a long objection argument, a short response is golden\r\n- GREAT controls once the witness starts fighting you on common sense things\r\n- I really like this pocket--it does line up with the way this cross started, I do see the inconsistencies/how he's been lying\r\n- Good tone, go slower in transitions especially\r\n- Great legal pad usage for writing down earlier testimony\r\n- Good repeating the question but shorter when the witness gives a long answer\r\n- Good impeachment but slow down when reading the inconsistent line\r\n- This cross is too long.\r\n- Tighten your questions so that the witness cannot flat no you (when you aren't intending them to)\r\n- Good recovery to awkward pause due to witness's laptop dying\r\n- "Yes, exactly, and I want to talk about what happened later." -- try more distinct transitions that tell me what your next line of questioning will be about	9	9	7	7	- GOOD ACCENT\r\n- It grabbed my attention for sure, very fun\r\n- You're super funny, well done, but your team didn't save enough time for your direct	- Great agreeing with the attorney when you can, makes you looked unbiased\r\n- Fights are minimal and good\r\n- Accent holds up on cross\r\n- Careful of your expressions during objection arguments \r\n- "Actually no it was $400" -- hilarious but don't be too cheeky. Try to respond like a real person would if someone said the wrong amount.	- Good line of questioning\r\n- Good tone\r\n- Did your best given limited time, it was somehow still a clear direct so good job cutting questions on the spot	- Needs a little more energy right out the gate\r\n- When you're crossing a witness as energetic and amusing as this one, your energy levels have to be off the charts to match his\r\n- Witness answers "it depends" and you just moved on instead of controlling. Make sure you're listening to the witness's answers.	8	- Interesting analogy about the truth\r\n- Careful of hand gestures that are enormous too close to the camera\r\n- Good using damning quotes from trial\r\n- Good derision/chuckle of disbelief, this is good for tone but use sparingly\r\n- Good getting softer at some points\r\n- Could signpost different sections of closing by moving to a different part of the screen (ex. when you go into your burden pocket, move to the other side of the screen)\r\n- Good variation in pace\r\n- You have what we call a "broken arm" -- one arm remains bent the entire closing, and you only gesture with that arm. Try putting your arms at your side instead when they are resting, and try gesturing with both arms\r\n- Closing needs a better roadmap. Tell me what you're going to tell me, tell me the main points you'll cover, then go into them. It's hard to follow because it jumps from place to place\r\n- "It's on your screen right now." -- can do without lines like this, the jury will see it\r\n- "It was no accident. There was no mistake." Great slow, deliberate delivery. \r\n- Remind me what the questions are when you say "yes, yes, and yes." Put them on the screen.\r\n- Ask to find guilty at the end is too fast, throwaway. This is a very important part of your closing, say it like you mean it.\r\n\r\nRebuttal\r\n- Great theme flip, Cameron AND Whit\r\n- Good fast pace for this list of facts in your favor\r\n- Good repeating your theme, good laying it out for me\r\n- Stop while you're ahead! You don't need to use all your time, this rebuttal was good right after you said your theme\r\n- Rebuttal goes on for too long, tries to do too much\r\n- You ran out of time when you could have stopped much earlier.	8	- Great emotion for storytelling at the beginning\r\n- Good clear statement of theme which was not as clear during opening; glad closing clarified this\r\n- Good setting up alternate theory of what happened\r\n- Great volume\r\n- Good hand gestures\r\n- Person as a rose metaphor is not necessary and just confusing. Speak more plainly, be more direct.\r\n- Need to slow down when transitioning to a different part of your closing; transitions are indistinguishable, making closing difficult to follow\r\n- Need to have moments where you drop low in volume for emphasis\r\n- "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury" said too often\r\n- You need to move to indicate transitions\r\n- Good mirroring their language "we've answered their three questions with no, no, and no." Excellent responsiveness. Could have gone one step further and displayed their questions (have co-counsel take a screenshot of it) and cross them out	28	119	85	90	86	239	88	240	237	243	t
155	7	Theme: A clear aim in the dark\r\nIt's really good that you are mentioning the legal elements of charges in great detail, but I would appreciate if you could paraphrase it in a less technical way. Remember that jury members are all lay persons, who have no knowledge of the law, and you need to think about how to make the laws more easily understood. Also, need to mention burden of proof.	8	Theme: She was terrified, she tried, she made a mistake.\r\nGood mentioning burden of proof and reasonable doubts. Very fluent. Nice opening.	8	7	7	7	Nice character. Great acting.	Great 50 percent response. Good that you maintained your character throughout cross.	Great foundations and flow.\r\nRemember that Issacs' own out-of-court statements may still count as hearsay as long as it is offered for the truth of the matter asserted. It doesn't matter if Issacs is testifying to her own out-of-court statement. If it is an out-of-court statement made for the truth of the matter asserted, then it is hearsay.	Good hearsay objection to Issacs' own out-of-court statement.\r\nGreat substantially more prejudicial than probative response.\r\nDon't ask the witness to make inferences (I'm referring to the question of whether the person is more likely than not to be Poole). She is not going to give you the answer you want.	8	7	7	7	Great character and great outfit.	Great maintaining your character.	Remember that when you want to offer statements about a person's state of mind (e.g. being angry, reluctant, etc.), you need to lay foundations regarding how the witness may reasonably have that knowledge. This means that any statements of the state of mind need to be preceded by a detailed description of what the witness perceived to allow her to make that kind of inference (e.g. detailed description of an angry face). Otherwise, it is speculation.\r\nMissed hearsay objection in cross when Floyd is quoted.	Good speculation objections during direct. \r\nGood line of questioning about how Longstreet never witnessed anything himself.\r\nNever say that you will be laying foundations and then just end the cross right there. Also, it is not preferable to end a cross with an objection.	6	7	6	5	I totally understand that technical issues happen, and that it is not your fault that it happens. But the unfortunate situation has made it hard for me to access your performance with a black screen and glitchy audio. Just make sure to have it fixed before round 3.	It is very good that you sound confident and are actively correcting what the crossing attorney is stating incorrectly. You are familiar with your lines, and sound like you know what you are talking about - very nice.	Try not to comment on the witness' answer (e.g. that's unfortunate; that's terrible), just ask the questions.	Make sure to get your facts straight when conducting the cross. Factual mistakes make you sound like you don't know what you are talking about. Also, it would give room for the witness to give long statements explaining the situation, which is something you wouldn't want to see during cross. You want to fully control the witness instead of letting her explain things in favor of her side.\r\nAvoid compound questions. In cross, you would want your questions to be as concise as possible so that there is no room for the witness to give long explanations. For the same reason, never ask open-ended questions such as "Can you elaborate". You want to be the star of the show during cross, so do not let the witness steal it.	7	6	7	7	I like the vibe you created for the witness.	Try not to get impeached. Make sure to be familiar with your affidavit. When the attorney repeats the question with something like "is it your statement that ...", it means that she is about to impeach. Unless you are absolutely sure that the opposing counsel is making a mistake here, sometimes it may be wiser to just concede at that point to avoid impeachment.	Try to avoid questions too general such as "did you observe anything strange", "what did you do next", etc. Questions like that make the conversation sound less natural, and make it seem like you have nothing specific to ask.	Great relevance objection response.\r\nTry to be more prepared for impeachment. The impeachment loses its effect if it gets dragged on too long. The jury may start to forget what you are trying to impeach. Also, it counts toward your time.	7	7	7	6	The acting is really natural and fluent.	Good that you are still sounding very natural and maintaining your character.	Try not to end the direct with an objection battle. There are no specific wrongs with it, but it just does not look good.	Several missed hearsay objections during direct.\r\nTry to make the questions shorter and more concise. The benefit of doing that is that 1. it gives the witness less room for explanations; 2. it is easier to follow for the jury.	6	5	7	6	It is pretty obvious that you are keep looking down at something beside you. It makes me feel like you are reading off a script. Your tone and pace are also too monotonous, which doesn't sound like a real person having a natural conversation.\r\nI like the Bowman-Poole used to be in a relationship narrative. Very smart.	You need to sound more confident during cross, maybe add some comments from time to time. Don't just say "yes" all the way through. You need to stand your ground and make it sound like you know what you are talking about, instead of seeming to be unsure about everything. Don't let the attorney control you.	It would be better if you can be clearer with the control buttons. (If I'm understanding correctly) I kinda get that you want to emphasize that the button and the handle are at the same relative position. You need to ask the witness to explicitly states that.	Make sure that you turn on the camera. I totally understand that you want to avoid internet instability, yet a completely black screen is even worse than a few instabilities from time to time. Your presentation is a huge part of our evaluation.\r\nGood calls for speculation objection response.\r\nTry not to comment on the answers (e.g. "Awesome", "that's nice"), just ask questions.\r\nCould have ended with a better question. Especially, when you say "last question", it would attract my attention, and I would be expecting a strong ending.	7	Theme: A clear aim in the dark\r\nIt is a little obvious that you are reading off a script. Your script is strong, yet you are speaking too fast. Need to add pauses from time to time to emphasize important points. \r\nPresentation matters a lot in mock trial. A good script is not enough. You need to try to slow it down and add more pauses and tone changes relative to the content of your statement.	9	Good presentation and pauses. \r\nGreat explanation of burden of proof and reasonable doubts.\r\nI think your closing has a strong structure. Together with the great presentation, makes it very convincing. Keep up the good work.	35	164	173	49	171	54	169	53	52	174	t
59	8	"Defendant opened the door".\r\nNice story telling! I like the emotion through the opening. I don't quite understand the point of having knowledge of robbery. Do you mean the defendant have the plan? Overall it is a very nice opening.	6	Is the theme "the defendant is the victim?" Kind of confused for me. It is not right to say she is the victim. \r\nVery strong emotion.  I like the demo. Three reasonable doubts are good points and they are clear. The third point is quite strong.	9	9	7	6	Couple nice jokes.  Nice and reliable witness. Your character seems trustable for me and you look like a boss -- that's nice!	Nice responses on the bias pocket. You are not too defensive and this is good!	I'm quite confused on the first pocket of the financials of the park. This pocket is long on the ticket price etc. Overall the transitions are smooth but there are some questions seems confusing for me. Nice hearsay objection. Nice handle on the party opponent.	Missed some objections on relevance and lack of personal knowledge. Starting with a bias pocket is good. Don't say too many "am I correct". The pocket of Kimball is weird because so far we don't know who Kimball is. You can speak slower on the objection battle. Don't mention about the lack of foundation -- they object that you didn't lay out 803 exception, I'm confused as well which exception you used.  Why 801? We are talking about the 803 exception. I believe the behavior changes still related with the character evidence.  If it is possible, you can just add this to the character form.	9	9	8	7	Very energetic character. I love this character very much. You speak clear and slow with a lot energies and this is awesome.	Nice attitude on cross! A very nice character on "don't know what happened." It makes you more reliable. I love the Chuggie's joke lol.	I like the question of distances. Overall very clear line-ups and I can understand your point clearly. Nice response on the prejudicial objection battle. A really nice story. This direct is very interesting to hear.  Nice handling of the hearsay objection.	403 Prejudicial objection -- this is not prejudicial. If there's a bias pocket, then maybe yes. Based on your reasoning, it seems more like a lack of personal knowledge -- it is still a little weak. The objection reasoning is too long -- make it short and sweet otherwise it is so confused. \r\nNice cross. Some questions are compound.	7	8	7	7	Looks like you are reading. You have a very reliable character as an expert.	Nice responses in the cross. You looks professional and know your knowledge.	The 702 pocket is nice. Great response on the hearsay objection battle -- you picks a good rule of evidence. This is a small point but just to be aware how you refer to your witness -- in your 702 you told that she is a detective and you referred her as doctor again. Overall this is a nice direct.	What are you objecting for? It seems to me you are objecting 702 and lack of foundation. \r\nI understand the point you would like to make, but it is a little weird to ask about whether normal being would be afraid of the gunshot. Nice questions on the locker and fingerprint. This cross is too long.	6	4	7	8	I like the background and the props. The character is very energetic and interesting. Though you looks a little bit disrespectful for the court with your customs and all the tattoo. You defend for yourself too much. \r\nYes I like your character, but I think you are a little too aggressive and defensive. I understand as a defendant you need to defense yourself, but this really hurt your reliability and hurt your case as well.	Answer the question! Don't joke and play around too much. Respect the other attorney. Don't cut off the other attorney. Your attitude is not respectful. Why you seems so impatient on cross? If this is the strategy, please drop it. \r\nWhy you keep ask the other attorney 'do you hear me'?	I agree the way you talked about Poole is character evidence. Also why do we need this character trait? For me this is not relevant.	Nice prejudicial objection. Nice character evidence objection. Nice control during the cross. It is a hard cross.	8	7	7	8	Why are you a victim?\r\nNice character! You make all the details very clear.	You preforms well but you seems unsure during the last bias pocket. A	Nice pocket on ticket booth. Sweet and clear. \r\nOverall short and sweet direct.	This cross is short and sweet. The pocket lines well and you make your point very clear.	7	6	7	7	This background is improper for the court. The props are nice. You have a character -- this is nice.	Again, answer the question. You should not give a lot long answers, and don't ask the other attorney why they ask this question.	Your response to witness's answer shows your energy. You are really listening.	Nice objection! \r\nShort and sweet cross. I know the time limit but you can act less aggressive next time.	10	I like the theme "he opened the door." \r\nNice tone!! Opened the door is really nice. Your point is very clear. Plan -- intention -- action. This timeline demo is awesome! Very nice and clear. You used the other side's theme -- very nice job!! \r\nYour rebuttal is very nice! You respond their close well.	10	Nice point on scientific, financial and forensic evidence. I understand your point but it is no special for the other side call her defendant. Though I like the "people" point. Nice point on innocent. You got the point -- the questions for reasonable doubt is fantastic. \r\nNow your case is clear for me. This is a very nice close.	3	149	21	25	50	49	24	22	23	55	t

33	5	I love how you opened with your theme! Just make sure you repeat this theme during your opening so that it sticks with the jury and we can remember it.\r\nYou did a good job laying out what each witness would bring to the case. The story you explained in the beginning was a little too long. The time spent on that could have been used instead to explain the elements or the burden of proof. Deep breaths and slow down. Make sure you enunciate.	10	Very clear opening! I love how you used your hands to be as engaging as possible over the screen. The only big critique I have is to just remind you to repeat your theme so the jury can remember it throughout trial. I love how you clearly explained each element and gave the jury 3 facts to look out for. Great job!!	7	4	8	8	I love how you used your hands to engage the jury with your testimony, especially with exhibit 11 when you were demonstrating how the black lever worked. You have good chemistry with your attorney	While you have good chemistry with your directing attorney, just remember you can't talk too much on cross the same way you can on direct. It was good to be evasive, but you were a little *too* evasive that caused you to be impeached. Just be careful with that!	You have a very great attorney presence! You're calm and cool, which comes across great on direct.  You kept an ear out for objections and did an amazing job breaking the defense's flow on cross examination.  When your witness was impeached, I would recommend redirecting so that you have the opportunity to restore any lost credibility.  Great use of the exhibit!	Very good assertive control over the witness.  Review some of your rules of evidence because there were times you had a good objection, but you were not able to argue it properly.  Overall, well done with impeachment! That was a great catch and well executed!	7	7	8	10	Good chemistry on direct, but I would recommend more energy to make it more engaging. You did a great job narrating your testimony!	Good job staying consistent on cross the same way as you were in your direct.	Great attorney demeanor! My favorite part of the direct was how you looped your question that made it easier for the jury to follow along.	Great control during cross!\r\nA small critique to make your cross better would be to use an exhibit or demonstrative.	7	7	4	9	There was not much character that I noticed. It was not a bad direct, but it was also not memorable or particularly engaging. One thing I'll point out is that as a witness, you cannot speak on behalf of your attorney.  If there's an objection, your attorney must respond, not the witness. I appreciate your enthusiasm, though!	You kept your credibility well during cross and didn't get impeached. Good job keeping the same energy you had in direct in cross as well.	It's okay if you don't have a response to an objection! Just make sure you let the judge know so we can continue smoothly with trial. I would recommend going over your rules of evidence and practice. You've got this!! Please make sure you enunciate! It can be hard, but slowing down  and speaking up helps.	Great objection right off the bat with the expert witness foundation. Good demeanor during cross. You had great control and got all the information you needed.	9	8	9	6	Great accent and character! Loved the chemistry between you and your attorney. The direct was so engaging and fun to listen to.	The only critique I have on cross would be that you dropped your accent at times during cross. I know it's difficult, but try and stay consistent! Overall great performance on cross as well.	This was such a great direct! What a great way to start off the defense case-in-chief. I loved the energy from you as the attorney. You did a good job looping your questions to make it easier for the jury to follow. I loved the chemistry you and your witness had. \r\n\r\nThe only critique I have is that you shouldn’t have re-directed! The prosecution's cross examination was not strong enough to hurt your witness in a bad way, but when you re-directed the witness, you were making it seem like something in the cross hurt your side from the jury's perspective.	You had good control over your witness, but be more confident in yourself and your questions! You had good questions, but it seemed like you were doubting yourself sometimes. Try objecting during the other side's direct examination to break their flow.	9	9	9	7	I loved the joke you made in the beginning about driving.  Even though you didn't have a bold or big character, your performance was still very engaging and consistent on both direct and cross. Great energy!	Good job asking the crossing attorney to clarify questions when you were confused. It came across as very professional and helped your credibility as a witness.	Very conversational direct. The way you looped your questions made it easier for the jury to follow. Your demeanor as an attorney is very relaxed and confident.	You made great objections! Even though some of them were overruled, your arguments were amazing and we as the judges were definitely taking note of how good your responses were. Don't let overruled objections get in the way of your confidence. Your confidence was so strong until you lost an objection and that affected your confidence during cross.  There were times the witness was talking too much on cross and you did a great job controlling the witness. \r\n**Instead of using 804 for against the interest of the declarant, use 801(d)(2) for party opponent since the statements were made by Bowman and you are on the Prosecution side**	9	9	9	9	Great job having the jury pity the defendant. You didn't seem like a criminal at all! Great communication during the demonstrative. I have no major critiques to make. Excellent work!	Loved how you kept your character consistent in direct and cross examination. You didn't become hostile during cross, which was great for your credibility.  \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would say to be careful about was that there was a time when you were being questioned on your fingerprints and your put your head in your hands. I understand this is consistent with your character who is teary-eyed and someone to pity, but it could come across to the jury like you were upset about the fact that you were caught. This is a super small critique, but it's just something to keep in mind: how our actions can be depicted differently over Zoom.	Loved the use of demonstratives on exhibit 11! Just remember: when an exhibit is already entered into evidence you don't need to enter it in again.\r\nYour questions were responsive to the witness's answers that made your direct seem more natural.	Your questions did a great job establishing a direct motive and opportunity for the defendant committing the crime. Great job making your points dramatic! Each one was executed very well! When you used exhibit 11 to show how the witness was wrong, that was great!! \r\n\r\nThe only big critique I have is that you would cut the witness' responses. Instead you could say, "So that's a yes to my question?" or "I appreciate your response, but that did not answer my question. My question was..." or "Redirecting you back to my question..."	10	Such a clear closing argument! You walked us through who had the knowledge, the means, and the motive. Good explanation of the burden of proof. I loved how you utilized your cross to emphasize the blame on the defendant during your close. \r\n\r\nThe only critique I have is for you to utilize voice inflection a little bit more. Get quiet and loud strategically  to engage the jury even more than you already are! Great closing!\r\nYour rebuttal was	10	I love how heavy you described the prosecution's burden! I loved how you slandered each of the prosecution's witnesses and took away their credibility and evidence. Your passion was engaging and made your closing even stronger.\r\n\r\nGood job pointing out the difference between what you agree with the prosecution with and what you did not.	16	141	99	105	171	101	103	100	104	174	t

You need to explain the "beyond reasonable doubt" more in your opening. It is one of the most important part in your opening.	9	8	8	8	I like your energy and character.		I like your reasoning for the excited utterance exception.\r\nSlow down at the knife part. It should be a very important part of your direct.	Good objection for hearsay, but you need to explain more about it and rebut the exception.

You are a little bit nervous in your answers. It is ok to answer no or I do not know.	Your direct pace is really good. You can raise more objections in their crossing.	"I suspect" should remind you of speculation objection.	8	7	8	9	I like your energy.\r\nSlow down your answer.	You should not fight too much for your side.

245	7	I'm a fan of this theme, does a good job of highlighting a few different parts of your story. But the framing you use in the demo of "panicked and therefore planned" feels weird — the panic part of the story seems like it should be the shorter, more immediate part while the plan is over a longer time frame.\r\n\r\nSince they're admitting to theft by deception you should be super clear about that in opening, that's a big part of the case clarified right there.	7	Not totally sold on your theme, I like the point you're going for with how you talk about the friendship but this phrase doesn't seem like a great way of getting at it.\r\n\r\nSome nice rhetoric about the burden, but also some strange rhetoric that I don't really see connecting to the idea of reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nBe more clear about admitting to theft by deception so the jury isn't confused.	7	8	10	8	I like the bit of character you add to this witness, but it does feel like you could use more variation in your delivery — your tone and pace seem to stay pretty similar throughout.

Nice demeanor on direct, you give off the impression that you're genuinely interested in the answers to your questions.\r\n\r\nExcellent "weight not admissibility" response to the lack of personal knowledge objection, you very nearly convinced me to overrule it. And great job reasking the question to get a clean ending after I sustained.\r\n\r\nVery good character evidence objection.	I definitely agree with your improper opinion objection, but I wish you'd been able to give more of an argument for it so I could see that you understand the reasoning behind it.\r\n\r\nGood lack of personal knowledge objection and argument even though I overruled you.\r\n\r\nGreat job pivoting from more prejudicial than probative to lack of personal knowledge when I nudged you. Thanks for moving to strike.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to say this goes to credibility you'll need to have a better explanation of how, I don't quite see the link between "she doesn't care about safety" and "her testimony in this trial can't be trusted."	9	9	9	8	I really like your character, you do a great job staying professional and confident with a bit of a soft-spoken demeanor. Your explanations of the evidence come across clear and credible. \r\n\r\nOh I'm a fan of how you highlight how strange it is that the robber would run into the park rather than away, using common sense to show suspicious behavior pointing to the defendant.	You seemed generally credible on cross, I liked your explanations. Blaming the zoom camera for not being able to tell the wristbands apart was a nice save.	Strong objection responses throughout, nice to see you know 703 but I think you were right to pivot to your not-an-assertion response, that was well-justified.\r\n\r\nWhen I did sustain that narrative objection though I think you just went back to the same question and answer.	Good try with that 702 objection and I would have even liked to see you reraise when they got to an opinion, I think this witness's expertise is worth challenging.\r\n\r\nSome powerful cross points, but also a couple that didn't really land for me. I didn't understand how some of the questions about Poole were important for your case, same with part of your pocket about the wristbands. But showing the wristbands on your camera was very fun and flashy, great idea.	9	10	9	7	Love the high energy character, you took on a distinct personality that was very fun to listen to. Great job getting out the facts quickly and ending on a strong point.	Fabulous performance on this cross, you managed to steal the show and make it feel almost like an extension of the direct. In some cases I'm pretty sure you were literally adding in direct material you had to cut for time, but you made it work perfectly with the character, I loved "oh I HAVE to tell you about that conversation."\r\n\r\nRarely a fan of outright snarkiness as a witness, but when she starts by criticizing the way you spell your own name I think it's justified.\r\n\r\n"I ship it" is such a bold thing to say about the defendant and their alleged co-conspirator, somehow you make it work.	Super efficient direct, great job getting through all the info you needed in the time you had, even with screensharing those exhibits.\r\n\r\nGood job standing up for your witness when she was cut off on cross.	Some good questions, but overall your cross didn't really seem to be building up to anything.	8	7	7	10	Straightforward character, relatable without using a ton of emotion from the start.\r\n\r\nI like the way you escalate into desperation when you get to the moment of crisis, but you seem to lose that emotion very abruptly when you move on the next topic.\r\n\r\nSlightly weird note to end on.	Your initial panicked answer about lying felt overly suspicious, but I liked the Les Mis tangent, it felt cute and nerdy and ironically not like something a guilty person would say.\r\n\r\nWatch out for your demeanor on some of those answers, there's sometimes a fine line between portraying realistic emotion and seeming like you're scrambling to hide something.\r\n\r\nIndividually some of your fights make a lot of sense, they might land a bit better if you mixed things up by giving some simple answers, but you don't get overly aggressive or hostile so it's not a big issue. Explicitly saying you're going to give an answer and clarify when she pushes for a yes near the end is a weird tactic that feels a bit unrealistic for a regular person to say, but it was surprisingly effective at stopping her from getting the punchy ending she wanted!	Yeah don't think you had any other options than offering to strike that "because I look like her ex" comment, pretty clearly inadmissible.\r\n\r\nGood use of screensharing the exhibits, effective at moving the story along.\r\n\r\nNot really sure what you were going for with that assumes facts not in evidence objection, she can ask the witness about what he told the police without using any exhibit.\r\n\r\nNice try with the badgering objection.	Yeah definitely a correct lack of personal knowledge objection.\r\n\r\nLove the lying question at the start to put him on his back foot, delivery could have maybe been a bit more flashy but it was still good.\r\n\r\nExcellent witness control when he was fighting, pushing for a yes or a no. This cross is long but as a defendant cross that makes sense and you get across a bunch of good points.\r\n\r\nI sustained based on the arguments given, but I think you're technically right that Mr. Bowman can't be constructively sequestered — not because he has to be a party representative, but because 615(a) does not authorize excluding a party who is natural person, which Mr. Bowman is.	9	8	8	8	I like the contrast you create between your professional tone going through the data and the emotion when you're talking about how you were threatened.	You seem to pretty quickly lose the emotion you had at the end of the direct — you can let it linger a bit. You do bring it back later though when she's asking about the knife and such, so good job with that.	Interesting choice to use this witness as an expert! Opens up some neat options for defense.\r\n\r\nGood 803(6) response. Still don't buy the credibility argument.\r\n\r\nAsking your own traumatized witness to calm down comes across as a bit weird.	Nice try with that hearsay argument but it was a pretty clear 803(6). I think you were right about the character evidence though.\r\n\r\nI like the structure of your cross questions but you could vary your tone a bit more.	7	6	8	8	Fun character moment taking photos during the objection battle, but make sure you're listening to the objection too! I sustained to you saying she hated spending money, and you immediately used the same phrase again. She didn't reobject though so no harm done.	Didn't see a whole lot of character coming through on cross, and some of your fighting didn't seem the most effective, but you still came out of it looking reasonably credible.	Good use of the character evidence exceptions to wiggle out of that issue but I don't think you even had to go there in the first place. I think this pretty clearly isn't improper bolstering because they've absolutely attacked the defendant's character for truthfulness, it was a huge part of their cross.	Spot-on lack of personal knowledge objections. But if I sustain and the witness says the same thing again when asked to rephrase, make sure you reobject!\r\n\r\nYou agreed that they gave notice they'd be showing this character trait but I don't think they actually did, the only trait of the defendant I see listed on the form is peacefulness and that's not what this testimony is speaking to.\r\n\r\nHit some good points on cross.	10	Oh I really like this "nothing to hide" framing at the start of closing, very fun.\r\n\r\nGood job emphasizing the defense admitted to theft by deception, that's the clearest that's been established all trial.\r\n\r\nYour section about the defendant taking over the ride is especially strong.\r\n\r\nGreat tone and pace throughout.\r\n\r\nExcellent theme-flip on rebuttal, that was just waiting to be made.	5	I still don't feel like the phrase "ride or die" really helps me latch on to any part of your case.\r\n\r\nYour delivery seems a bit awkward and you mostly run straight through from each line to the next, it could be stronger with more variation in pace, clear transitions, dramatic pauses, and so on.\r\n\r\nI think you somewhat overuse the power point, pulling it up a slide to highlight key points can be effective but if it's up there all the time with a bunch of different text it gets a bit distracting from what you're talking about.\r\n\r\nReally don't think the name spelling was remotely worth closing on, and definitely not putting on your demo. It just seems petty.	70	130	85	90	86	44	89	88	45	48	t

105	8	"She would do anything to cover it up" - theme\r\n\r\nI love the use of screensharing to effectively show the points that the prosecution has to prove in this case. Good anticipation of defense arguments, will see if this is fruitful later on. \r\n\r\nThis is a criminal case, so it's very important to get the terminology correct. "Preponderance of the evidence" is reserved for civil cases, as preponderance of the evidence only refers to more likely than not. Criminal cases require evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. I think you caught this by ending the statement with "find her guilty," but don't use the word liable here for the sake of clarity.	8	Not much of a coherent theme, but I like how you set the scene for the jury. You started to go into the importance of beyond a reasonable doubt and how the burden rests solely on the prosecution. Go into that further! The jury doesn't fully understand the burden of a criminal prosecution, so it's important to emphasize what exactly "beyond a reasonable doubt" means and that, in all reality, the defense doesn't have to even present witnesses, but nevertheless y'all are going to! \r\n\r\nPretty good theme potential with Bowman being in the wrong place at the wrong time as well as the prosecution being "blinded by the need to blame." It would be good to clarify a one to two sentence theme so that the jury has something to refer to when trying to comprehend your case. \r\n\r\nAccident theory -- the lever was hit on accident and that Bowman didn't know anything about the robbery beforehand.\r\n\r\n"False justice is not the solution for our sorrow" - love this	9	8	7	8	Older character witnesses are a classic in mock trial -- love the costume! Plus, taking advantage of Zoom for humor is always a big plus. This varies with judges, but I would go further with the character! I love the voice, but write some jokes to go with the voice and the character herself!\r\n\r\nDon't directly admit to making cuts to ride safety.	Character witnesses have a lot of room to obfuscate bad cross points. Think of creative ways to avoid directly admitting to the negative points. Otherwise, pretty good answers to cross.	I love the use of the demonstrative to show the irregular business patterns, the transition from exhibit 7 to the line graph was very smooth and appreciated. Solid pace and tone with the witness, I felt that I got everything that the witness wanted to say.\r\n\r\nGood relevance objection to talking about a tax evasion incident from 12 years ago.\r\n\r\nMissed a relevance objection to finding the missing money during the investigation. That doesn't make the facts of THIS case more likely.	Never retract an objection! Even if you feel like you have lost, find something to say. If you want to keep out exhibit 7, may be better to object to improper expert testimony -- the prosecution needs to establish that Longstreet is able to reliably testify to financial records. Nevertheless, I really appreciate the effort towards making objections! Objections are where attorneys truly shine in mock trial, to make them is to show your rhetorical and logical acumen.\r\n\r\n"Yes or no question" - I love this. Great witness control.\r\n\r\nSolid cross points. And once again, great witness control. Making them say yes or no is immensely important to your case and to cross examinations in general.	8	6	8	8	Solid introduction to the witness, checking all the points -- backstory, education, and professional background. Some of your answers were pretty long-winded - it's important for an expert to have solid, concise answers so that the jury can understand all the complex concepts that you're establishing.\r\n\r\nWas it 5 or 4 inconsistent statements? Need to clarify that.	If the crossing attorney is giving you ammo - talking about your motives, it's possible to spin that to making yourself a more reliable expert because your background motivates you! When the crossing attorney asks you that your analysis wasn't based on real evidence, you don't have to agree!! That's absolutely not in your report, and saying yes to it does NOT bode well!	Good rapport with the witness as well as good pacing -- I felt like I could understand the methods and concepts behind the witness' analysis of the case. Great use of demonstratives to clearly establish the discrepancies in Bowman's words.\r\n\r\nDon't just stand by your objection, keep on responding no matter what. If the crossing attorney is interrupting the witness, object to badgering the witness!	Voir dires are always a treat to watch in mock trial - they are always cool and make attorneys look badass when done correctly. The discrepancies I saw in the voir dire should be reserved for cross, as the prosecution was tendering this witness as a financial crimes expert. I would pivot to lack of foundation with Isaac's meeting with Bowman, speculation does not work in that case.\r\n\r\nGood energy with cross examination. You can be a bit more aggressive with expert witnesses, so this was a welcome addition.\r\n\r\nAs frustrating as this is, never "take things for a yes or a no". Juries can't go off of that, they need a solid yes or no answer to each and every question. If anything, if the expert continues to prevaricate, it makes them look worse. Don't give them an out.\r\n\r\nRecrosses are a controversial topic in mock trial - I don't like them that much, but I understand why you did it.	7	6	7	9	I appreciate the character, but go further into the character! Character witnesses have the most freedom in mock trial to experiment with backstories and direct examination answers!	When the crossing attorney is trying to establish bias, don't play into it by saying "who would say no to $300" There are better ways to obfuscate the crossing attorney's points as a character witness in particular.	Good rapport with the witness. But I wasn't sure if the interruptions were on purpose or not, but if not, avoid interrupting the witness for future reference.	Interesting alternate accomplice theory - I think this gets a little lost with some of the accidental rhetoric in the opening statement so I would work on clarifying what you all are arguing throughout the case, especially in the opening statement. Solid tone with cross examination. Character witnesses are very hard to cross examine in mock trial, and I thought you did very well in terms of witness control.	9	6	8	9	Backgrounds and costumes are always fun in Zoom mock trial, so I appreciate you employing both. "sharpest crane in the box" - love it. At least, that's what I heard. \r\n\r\nGood pacing and variation in tone for the character. Very believable witness, striking a good balance between fun character and realism.	Make sure to have your affidavit remembered, otherwise you'll get caught pretty rough on cross examination and impeachments. Good job with maintaining a consistent energy and tone throughout the cross examination.	Attorneys should always match the energy of their witnesses -- you can do this is a number of ways. Vary your tone, begin asking questions a bit faster in more pressing sections of direct examination, etc...\r\n\r\nSolid	I think I saw Mr. Liu cross examining Bowman, but in any case, all good.\r\n\r\nCalling defendants liars directly is a bit polarizing in mock trial, but I like it. This is the defendant you're cross examining, so some righteous anger is due. Pretty solid impeachment!\r\n\r\nSolid witness control and great impeachment during the re-cross examination.	8	7	7	8	Quite the believable witness. I noticed that you sped up a little bit throughout your direct examination, so I would make sure to keep your pace consistently slow, even to the point of discomfort at times.	Pretty solid cross answers!	Good rapport with witness.	Can Hunter testify to the contents of the financial books? Solid witness control by restricting answers to yeses and noes.	9	9	8	7	"#trusttheprocess" -  i appreciate this. The character borders on a bit unrealistic, but I liked it nevertheless haha. I love the NBA references. I noticed that you were speeding up throughout your testimony - make sure to keep a consistent pace throughout. Otherwise the jury misses parts of your testimony and hurts the case overall.	Good job with maintaining the character throughout cross examination -- that's always the hardest part especially when being grilled by the crossing attorney and you did a good job. You also did well with not giving the crossing attorney any freebies, asking them to clarify and not agreeing to parts you don't have to	Good job matching the energy of the witness, creating good rapport. Solid speculation objection to whether Ms. Bowman considered a mistake.	Good job with witness control and asking for the yes and no answers that you need for the record. Although, this bordered a lot on being rude with interruptions, so please don't do this.	8	Good repetition of the theme. Great use of demonstratives to illustrate the scale of the crime you are alleging. Turquoise vs. bright blue is a bit of a shallow distinction to make, but I appreciate it nevertheless. Pretty good recap of the evidence presented by both sides, showing why you believe that the prosecution's evidence is more convincing than the defense. Good emphasis of the defendant's own words for your case. Good variation in tone and volume.	10	"Something is missing from the story" - Pretty good theme if that was the intention. Good emphasis on where the burden lies in this case -- entirely on the prosecution. I love the clear explanation of what exactly beyond a reasonable doubt means. It's often misunderstood, and a clear explanation to a lay jury is ALWAYS necessary. I love the pseudo demo flip, crossing out the parts of the prosecution's arguments. Good variation in tone and volume for the right parts of your speech. Great recap of what pieces of evidence would help the prosecution's case but were left out.	31	109	163	160	155	154	167	164	157	156	t

143	8	"She turned off the lights, she hides all her lies". Awesome energy. But I think you could use more of a buildup with your tone. An opening should seem like you're talking to your jury so try to have a more conversational tone. A little bit too dramatic throughout. Keep the story simple -- in your witness section lose some of the names/people. It's get's a little confusing to follow. Overall really nice job though.	6	Why the powerpoint? I would nix that going forward, I don't think you need it -- you have a good voice. Ease us into the story instead of giving us your version outright. Too many details too soon. Really good energy -- but a little bit too much for an open. If you're going to express your condolences you need to sound sad at that part haha.	7	7	8	5	I love your jacket. Great enthusiasm! Talking too fast though. Slow down a little bit because there's so many details. In the same vein -- keep details to a minimum, the less info you include, the easier it is for jurors to follow.	Don't lose character on cross. Nice job only fighting when necessary. Maintained credibility well.	Really nice job with the objection responses. Smooth flow with the witness and clarifying for judge when necessary. Make sure tone is conversational with questions.	Try to vary tone more. It can be helpful to find high and low points and change your delivery to emphasize those.	8	8	8	5	Very knowledgeable. Slow down!! Really great job walking through method. Great tone for an expert. Carry that over throughout the direct -- missing a little bit in the beginning. \r\n\r\nOkay now it's getting a little too heavy. You don't need this much info. Keep it to the bare minimum.	Great job holding up credibility on the impeachment.\r\n\r\n"I didn't owe him but is that a really big deal for you" too combative.	Smooth flow with witness. Try to be a little bit more laid back on tone of questions for DX. The tone you're using more is something that would fit better for CX or a speech. But good job modulating your tone slightly, that's tough to do on a DX.\r\n\r\nFor the hearsay objection -- it's admissible under 703. As I typed this you literally said it -- nice. \r\n\r\nI would not use lay witness response for that last question -- that totally sounds like an expert opinion -- i think you should just revise your field of expertise at the beginning to criminal investigations or something more broad so you don't have to go back and change the whole method.  \r\n\r\nThis is partially personal preference -- I don't like objecting hearsay to impeachments you know are wrong. Only because you don't need the points but your witness does. Better to let the witness shine and add points to her cross score (which your witness did) than to cut off her chance to boost her score. Especially because the CX score for the attorney will also go down if the impeachment goes badly.	I think you could have switched your character evidence obj to 403. If they're using it for familiarity, it can still be prejudicial because of the nature of the crime. They can lay the same foundation just by saying there have been interactions prior. \r\n\r\nBe careful with these objections -- lots of good ones in there, but you don't need so many. Baseline only 2-3 per exam unless absolutely necessary.  That last one was a great catch though. \r\n\r\nImpeachment on the CX wasn't worth it. I like that you went for the aggressive approach on CX	7	8	7	6	HA the beer mugs in the back. Nice. Great enthusiasm -- just want more realism and variation.	Nice job keeping character up on CX. Super likable.	The attorney editorializing his questions/adding commentary is objectionable -- attorney testifying. \r\n\r\nNice flow with witness. Direct could be shorter -- you don't need this much info. Not all of it is relevant. Find ways to condense your narrative. Cool demo.	Why object to get them to enter the exhibit just so you can object hearsay to the exhibit?\r\n\r\nI get why you were making the hearsay objection -- but I don't think the words above the buttons are statements. Either way, this exhibit is something that you need in evidence too even if just for the sake of clarity. \r\n\r\nMake your questions close ended. I get doing open once for the drama. But you should only do it once max.	6	6	6	8	Realistic witness. Need more energy.	Need more personality on the CX.	Good job on the objection response. Make sure to use language -- that only applies to pertinent character traits. And what character trait are you offering evidence of?	Why are you objecting -- do you really care if they were making jokes? Doesn't seem significant enough to keep it off the record. \r\n\r\nEasy to follow CX. Nice job. I love your tone on CX. You should have more of this conversational tone on DX. Awesome job.	8	7	9	9	haha why are you testifying from a car. Lol busting my ass off -- love to see it. This witness is hilarious omg.	You lost a lot of your character on CX. Make sure to keep it consistent throughout. But good job not fighting too much.	Very conversational on DX. nice tone. \r\n\r\nDid both parties stipulate witness is unavailable? Or is he dead? Just because he isn't testifying doesn't necessarily mean he is unavailable.	Hahaha nice responsiveness with the car thing at the beginning, I like it. Really easy to follow CX. Good delivery. Nice job.	6	5	5	9	Good job adapting to objections.	Good job adjusting to tech issues. CX portrayal was more natural than DX. Translate this to DX. Seemed too evasive on CX.	Don't editorialize "calm down this is court" section. Try your best to respond to objections or offer to rephrase instead of saying that you don't have a response.	Good job adjusting to the technology issues. Nice job with the impeachment. Love the aggression -- keep at it. Great delivery. Nice job listening to the witness and making sure that they stick to affidavit. CX was too long -- you don't need as many points as you're making.	9	You sort of change your voice between closing and other parts you perform. Be yourself. Awesome delivery and writing. Try to include more structure/breakdown for clarity. segment your evidence into points or ideas to make it easier to follow. Quote the trial more. Place us in the moment by using more descriptive language. Try to vary your tone more and integrate more pauses throughout.	6	Segment your evidence. Speak a little bit more slowly.  I like your passion but you need to vary your tone more. Close was too long. Need more evidence and quote the trial more.	40	142	1	3	7	37	2	38	4	5	t
191	7	Nice and strong voice. Great storytelling. I would be more intentional with your hand movements. \r\nI'm not sure if your script was on the screen or if you were just looking at the presider, but I would recommend looking directly at the camera. I know it's super difficult and awkward to do on Zoom mock trial, but it's something you might want to work more on to look more engaged.	8	Alternate suspect theory with Cameron, I get the burden of proof thing in the pre-trial matters now.\r\nGreat hook, really grabbed my attention. Great explanation of the prosecution's burden of proof and your lack of, but I think that's something that should be saved for close. Your opening statement sounded a little close-like to me.	6	6	7	6	To me, some of the jokes about Disneyland fell a little flat. Maybe you've had a long day and I totally get that but it seems that your character lends itself to a lot of energy. Bring up the volume!	More energy.	I think you need to look more engaged, try looking at the camera more. \r\nGood responses to objections, he threw a couple at you.	If there is an out of court statement you object to that has the response of "no truth value", make sure to ASK for a limiting instruction. It makes you look proactive. \r\nBe careful of being an overzealous objector. \r\nYou need more drama in your questioning, you sounded a little monotonous. \r\nWhat you said about "skipping the question" was a little awkward, I would have just not said that.	9	8	9	9	Love the energy you brought! You're a star! \r\nI did notice that your energy dropped a little after the objection battle, try to keep it up.	A lot of people have their energy wane off during cross—you didn't. Great job. \r\nJust be careful of cutting off the attorney, that's a huge pet peeve of mine.	Dingzhong, you have such a calm tone and responded to your objections in a slow steady manner. Fantastic skill to have. Keep it up. \r\nYou did a really fantastic job sounding engaged with your witness. \r\nThe only critique I have is maybe trying to match the energy of your witness so there is more balance. Haoqing is super energetic, which makes you seem a little less energetic. Does that make sense? If you up the energy a little bit more it will be perfect.	Nitpicky, but it's not "we believe it's an out of court statement", it's "this is an out of court statement"\r\nYou have a super strong cross demeanor, but slow down, it'll make you seem more confident.\r\nLoved the facial expressions, the hand movements, the engagement you have in this cross.	6	6	7	8	I don't know how feasible this is but I would be very careful about where I situate myself. I could barely see your face!	You're an expert, you have room in your cross testimony to expand on your responses. Utilize that!	Were all the prongs of 702 met? I'm not sure I heard everything. \r\nOkay, in terms of the lack of foundation problem, state IMMEDIATELY that your witness is an expert! They're allowed to make conclusions and then expand on them. \r\nWhen you know you're going to use an exception for an objection, pre-write that response out. It'll come out much smoother than it did here.	When you object, make sure it's strong—don't whisper your objection because people respond to strength in voice and demeanor when you object. Good job with the content and specificity of your objections.\r\nGood line of questioning with the "2 years" question. Good witness control.	8	6	6	8	You have good tone, you sound remorseful. \r\nWoah, I would caution against you saying the alternate suspect theory. It looks like you're trying to divert blame away from yourself. \r\nYou had really good emotion towards the end.	Your character dropped a lot when you got onto cross, be careful of that.	Interesting choice putting the defendant first in your call order, you might want to reconsider!\r\nYou need to up the volume a little bit.	Again, fantastic objection made and responded to by you. But be careful to slow down so you don't seem flustered. \r\nYour tone and pacing is perfect for a witness like this, but be careful of cutting off your witness. \r\nThe no operation of Tunnel of Terror was an example of good witness control.	8	7	7	5	Super good drama in your direct, the stingy park owner bit made me laugh.	Good job keeping your cool, especially during your impeachment and after she cut you off a couple of times.	The "three weird things" broken down was a bit awkward, but it was an admirable attempt to have a structure to your direct. \r\nGood catch with the hearsay objection during impeachment, but do note that attorneys are allowed impeachment by omission. In the future I'd just be careful of having what my witness say in case you have another situation like this. \r\nGood redirect given what your witness was just crossed on. Clean.	When you start an impeachment, go through the motions of actually authenticating the affidavit you're drawing from, otherwise, opposing counsel will object hearsay when you're trying to impeach (which happened here). This usually involves questions like, "this is your testimony?" or "this is your signature here?" \r\nDo NOT cut off the witness and say that they can expand in redirect! It's disrespectful.	5	5	7	7	I would be cautious of putting on an accent (was it Italian? Russian? I could not tell) if it is inconsistent.\r\nI would also not work in topics like alcoholism and domestic abuse in a character just for the sake of it, it's unnecessary and a little insensitive.	Your accent dropped a little in cross. Again, if you aren't able to keep it consistent, it's better not to do it.	Presider was right, your question made it easy for the witness to lapse into a narrative. Tighten up your questions a little bit. \r\nFor speculation, you have to listen very carefully to the wording. Opp. counsel asked specifically if the defendant "appeared" distracted, likely to avoid the objection.	Good catch on the narrative. \r\nI think you could have expanded on the bias pocket. They're really effective and typically does not open you up to tons of objections. \r\nOh wait! You do another little bias pocket about working with criminals. I would recommend consolidating all those questions so your questioning could be more organized. \r\nOkay, watch out on interrupting witnesses again. There are better ways to control a witness than interrupting them.	8	I love your tone and storytelling, you really are able to hook the listener in the first few passages. \r\n"Opened the door to all their crimes", great. \r\nI would have liked to see the demonstrative come up every now and again during the trial, it would have been more effective if we had seen you adding to it throughout the trial to really cement  what happened  that day.\r\nGREAT rebuttal, bringing in everything that has happened in the trial.	6	This is a super small thing, but I really loved your attention to detail during pre-trial matters (e.g. asking presider what his time zone was).\r\nMaybe I missed it but I really do not think that your team focused in on Cameron enough. The entire trial I was listening for the name, "Cameron", and I found that it only came out a few unsubstantial times and during the defendant's own testimony. When you choose an alternate suspect theory, you put somewhat of a burden on yourself, even if you explicitly state that the defense has no burden. You did not spend enough time zeroing in on your alternate suspect and it really was a detriment to your case. \r\nIf you are unable to bring up enough evidence to make it believable that someone else committed the crime, focus more energy on the questions that elicit reasonable doubt instead of wasting time on a witness you can't call. \r\nYou did a really good job poking holes in the prosecution's case, though! Do MORE of that! Good use of your demonstrative too.\r\nI would have loved a theme flip.	45	168	21	149	150	25	24	152	153	22	t
147	6	- Good to start with a theme\r\n- Good to have a narrative\r\n- I like how you break up and explain the details of the legal charges to the members of the jury.

I will like it better if you could make it into a narrative with a theme.\r\n- I think you can explain a little bit of the legal issues in your opening, for example, what is a reasonable doubt? Why, if the defendant did not know the full plan, meant that he is not guilty? what is the definition for accomplice.\r\n- Good introduction to all of the witnesses and what they are going to prove in today's case	8	7	7	6	- I like how you introduce yourself as a world citizen, especially when you pronounce all of the names of the nations;\r\n- Good explanation of the wristbands	- i remember you saying that cameron had a lot of friends in your direct\r\n- a little bit of change of attitude when you are facing the opposing counsel	- good flow; very smooth transition between the questions.\r\n- I like how you reference from the witness 'what do you mean by the numbers don't match'\r\n- I can see how you are trying to avoid some of the objections within your questions	- could argue character evidence for faking the wristband\r\n- good trying to object speculation, your instinct is right that there could be an objection here, but not speculation as it is about 'other people's state of mind', it could be 'lack of personal knowledge' or 'misleading'\r\n- I am not really sure if cameren is defendant or not, thus it could be hearsay, be careful everytime when the opposing side is reference something out of court\r\n- compound 'took the money and threaten you'\r\n- I like how you clarify the answer with asking if it is a yes or not	6	5	7	5	- Good explanation with your rule for the job	- dont use uhm as a yes in the cross\r\n- you have been hesitating a lot when you are answering the questions, that would be make the juries questions whether you remember the events clearly or not	- Good flow with the questions.\r\n- Good objections with hearsay	- when the witness references 6 inches when she is introducing the pic, you should be careful as it could be assuming facts not in evidence\r\n- has the defendant ever  could be leading\r\n- could be hearsay for what's showing on the screen of the cellphone\r\n- don't say that I will consider it as a no, that will be attorney testifying\r\n- I see where you are going with asking some of the questions, and I think there are some leaways that can work for entering some of the statement into the court record\r\n- you can review the rules for hearsay more\r\n- could be compound	6	5	7	7	- i didnt really know what was machine learning on the demon for	- when you are asking for refreshing your memories, it can put you into an disadvantage, making the members of the jury think that you do not remember the cases	- good foundation for the detective \r\n- good flow with the direct\r\n- don't panic when you see the time was running out\r\n- 'so that is a yes' that is counsel is testifying, 'so you terminat the interview' that would be counsel is testifying	- Be careful when the otherside is entering exhibit into evidence\r\n- You can try to object when the other side is using demonstrative \r\n- all of the words on the demon could be hearsay\r\n- good when you slow down for when the witness ask you to repeat, but when you hear that question, you should know that your questions may be too long	8	6	6	8	- good to be humor \r\n- i like how you talk to the members of the jury why you push the button; a very nice character	- You sound a bit defensive during the cross-examinations\r\n- I think you did a good job arguing the nuances in your affidavit and you can argue the definition of the 'used'	- be aware of questions starting with 'do you know?' could be leading\r\n- when your attorneys in the cross are trying to prove the knife don't belong to \r\n- def review the rule for hearsay.	- Good objection of hearsay and lack of foundation, you have a solid understanding for all of the rules of evidence. \r\n- don't say ' that's a yes to my question' that is counsel is testifying	7	7	5	6	- very obvious character	- a bit defensive during the cross, I see that you are trying to avoid some disadvantaged statement, but that can make you seem like a very biased and protective witness to the judge.

132	7	I'm not sure the theme "profit over people" quite applies for this case — it feels like it makes more sense talking about a company cutting corners than an individual helping with a robbery.\r\n\r\nClear and forceful speech, easy to understand.\r\n\r\nI feel like you have a bit too much of a focus on Poole and defendant being criminals in the abstract rather than their specific actions in this case.	7	I like the focus on "missing" in your theme, though the phrasing is a little bit awkward.\r\n\r\nFairly effective demo, helps to keep track of the three questions.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I totally buy the connection between Longstreet's stinginess and Bowman not being guilty.	8	9	8	7	I like that you put some character into this, though it feels like it shifts around wildly in those first few questions.\r\n\r\nGreat forceful delivery on some of the key facts that hurt the defense.	Good job not seeming too fighty, but you could find more chances to elaborate on answers in a way that works with your character.\r\n\r\nOh, very nice firm contradiction on what the detective told you!\r\n\r\nI like how you say you don't need him to repeat the question, stops him from getting a chance to make his point again.	Good tone.\r\n\r\nWatch the wording of your questions, sometimes you assume facts that the witness hasn't actually said yet.\r\n\r\nNice job adjusting the phrasing of your questions after objections.	I think your objections did a pretty good job of breaking up their flow, but when you argue that they need foundation make sure you're ready to give a clear explanation of what foundation they need and why.\r\n\r\nUse more signposts on cross (e.g. "Let's talk about...") to show what points you're trying to make.\r\n\r\nMake sure that you're asking questions that the witness has to agree to so you can control her if she says no.	9	10	8	9	Big fan of this character, feels like both a fun personality and a realistic ordinary person who overheard something.\r\n\r\n"Tried to convince a few teenagers to play Russian roulette" was a bit much.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the "don't want my other customers to know I do this" bit.	Very good job staying in character on cross. Some great reasonable resistance to her questions, like being up-front about not knowing who was on the phone.	Nice comfortable tone, gives you a good back-and-forth with this witness.\r\n\r\nYou clearly know some hearsay responses but make sure that you can back them up with an explanation of why they apply. It seems a bit like you're fumbling in the dark.	Great use of signposts, your points were very clear and logical.\r\n\r\nNice job being responsive to what the witness says.	7	8	8	9	Clear and professional delivery of your answers.\r\n\r\nMake sure you're listening to what I say in objection arguments, I said I wanted the text messages established as authentic and brought into evidence before you went into the contents, but then you immediately started walking through the contents.	You can expand your answers a bit more beyond a simple "correct," you have a long way to go before you start seeming overly combative.\r\n\r\nLoved your response that people aren't going to be saying the word robbery in their text messages.	Nice hearsay exception, and good job laying foundation and bringing the exhibit in when I asked for it. But make sure that when you get to the next exhibit you follow the procedure that I've already shown you I wanted.\r\n\r\nGood try using 703. And reasonable defense against the 702 objection, I just don't think there's enough basis for this opinion.	Good job calling them out on that basic foundation they were missing for the document. Solid hearsay arguments.\r\n\r\nExcellent 702 objection.\r\n\r\nStrange relevance response, I don't see how someone else's pay can show Poole's motive (or why we need to prove that at all, since everyone agrees Poole was in on it).\r\n\r\nGreat questions pushing on what she didn't investigate and the evidence she doesn't have.	8	7	8	9	Make sure you're not using especially legal language — "to my knowledge" usually isn't something a normal witness will just say out of the blue while telling their story.\r\n\r\nYou come across as sympathetic when talking about your shock at what Cameron did.\r\n\r\nGreat emotion near the end of your story.	Some of your fighting didn't seem very effective, felt more like excuses than reasonable explanations.\r\n\r\nI like that you didn't give her that odd point about muscle memory, you really have no way to know that.	Your relevance response could be a bit clearer — if she loves working somewhere that gives her less motive to rob it, right?\r\n\r\nI appreciated your objections to stop her from getting a clean impeachment.\r\n\r\nGreat job standing up for your witness when the attorney interrupted her!	Worthwhile speculation objection even though I overruled you.\r\n\r\nLove the way you establish that she knew about the stealing and then push for even stronger claims that you're ready for her to disagree with.\r\n\r\nNice witness control. But don't interrupt the witness, that makes you look like you're trying to badger the witness or keep something from the jury. Just wait for them to finish talking and then steer them back to the question.	7	8	9	7	I like the energy and emphasis you give to your lines. Try to add more variation to the rhythm of the answers.	Good job keeping your character up on cross, you felt like the same person and gave answers that were more interesting than just a yes or no without seeming overly combative.	Great relevance response, really used the chance to explain your case theory.\r\n\r\nNice try but don't say you're going to ask the witness to clarify or rephrase if you're just planning on moving on, I can obviously tell that you didn't go back and get the information in question.\r\n\r\nGood hearsay objection to the reference to Isaacs. Valid compound question objection even though I overruled you. Spot-on argumentative objections.	Great hearsay objection, really didn't let them get away with misrepresenting how she knows about this past accident.\r\n\r\nI think an improper character evidence to the defendant being nice would have worked better than speculation.\r\n\r\nYeah Isaacs' affidavit definitely isn't something you can bring up with this witness.\r\n\r\n"Why are you doing this?" was a very weird question, even following up with a yes-or-no question to clarify.	9	9	9	5	Fun character, you're really committing to the old man bit and it pays off.\r\n\r\nIncredible job leaning into your character during the connection issues.\r\n\r\nThe coughing might have made more sense during an answer than interrupting one of your attorney's questions, but it was fine the way you did it.	"What is 'muscle memory'?" was honestly a great answer, I feel like that's what a lot of people would say in response to that question.\r\n\r\nGood job staying in character in general and fighting in realistic ways.	Questions flow smoothly from one to the next.\r\n\r\nNice objection, not letting them build up momentum at the start of the cross.\r\n\r\nExcellent job pushing on those objections, especially when you saw they didn't have any response.	Smooth rephrasing.\r\n\r\nDefinitely don't ask the witness to elaborate on why he doesn't know, falling back on that sort of open-ended question is always dangerous because you never know how the witness is going to respond.\r\n\r\nOkay I'm all for building a rapport with the witness you're crossing but actually calling him "old man" is probably a bit much.\r\n\r\nGet more comfortable with hearsay rules, you weren't able to effectively respond. A lot of these quotes aren't hearsay because they're not asserting anything, they're just questions or requests that aren't claiming anything to be true.	9	Starting with the "white lies" point from cross was interesting, I think you could have done more to make it flashy and rhetorically pretty but it's definitely a fun and strong point to come out the gate with.\r\n\r\nYou actually do an incredible job of making your points very clearly and directly, like I'd expect to see in casual conversation — like how what they're saying about old equipment doesn't make any sense. The one thing I think you can work on is making your framing just a bit more polished and theatrical, so that it's more compelling than just raw facts can be.	9	Ooh I really like the way you extend the theme into your section on everything Poole was seen doing that can't be linked back to Bowman.\r\n\r\nI like going back to the demo from opening and marking it off.\r\n\r\nBold but effective choice to lean into the stance that a witness contradicting herself in an interrogation doesn't actually show she's guilty of anything.	29	130	148	149	140	150	136	151	137	138	t
106	7	It's pretty obvious that you are reading, and there's no storytelling.  There's no emotion when you tell the story.	8	You sound really firm and clear, that's great. The character evidence part is a bit unconvincing. You can include more evidence in response to those presented by the prosecution rather than just saying Bowman knows nothing.	9	8	8	6	I like the trick designed in the beginning hhh. Good presentation of your character and accent. Nice demo (the math equation). I like the storytelling, but it's kind of confusing to me you started talking about Bowman being told not to press the button and trained, etc before telling me what happened that night.	Good response and good maintenance of your character. Don't fight too much "I'm not a detective" or "I'm a rational person"???	I can't really see anything through the screen sharing. Try to highlight the important part (cut it out). Be sure about your ground. Catch the keyword "substantially." When getting this objection just tell the probative value. It's an excellent chance to retell your case theory. Motion to strike.	Say your honor before answering. "I stand by my objection" or check with the co-council. Withdrawing an objection is very weak. Reasonable objection on prejudicial.  You don't sound professional with a lot of colloquial words. Too many objections. Missed improper character evidence objection. Bad response to relevance objection. It has nothing to do with character evidence, so 404b is irrelevant. Speak professional language!!!!!!!! I don't see the relevance of the questions asking about the two police officers. This case theory is pretty weak. "Do you agree with him emotionally"???	7	6	7	7	There's just some problem with your case presentation. We are hearing loads of evidence and names without knowing what happened. Your opening statement isn't clear enough to lay all the foundations. You should call some storytelling witness at first.	You lost your character during the cross-examination. Don't be too fighty cuz you are an officer, you are credible only if you stay neutral.	The probative value is truthfulness. It's related to the credibility of the witness.  An expert in financial crime is not allowed to talk about the truthfulness of Bowman in the investigation of the robbery case. Missed a lot of badgering the witness and counsel testifying objections.	Good try on voir dire. You can still object because she's only an expert in financial crime. Why can she talk about the investigation in the Bowman case? Good objection on Billy Issacs. Pay attention to the quality rather than quantity of objections. Also, don't object too much to form, especially "relevance" and "substantially more prejudicial than probative" because the admission bar is very low and you can easily give the opposing council a chance to restate their case theory. Don't cut out your witness, bro It's too aggressive. But good questions about the trace of financial crime. Don't always say  I'll take this as a yes. no need to recross.	9	10	8	8	Good character.	Good maintenance of the character, and good actions	Those are not hearsay because it's not a statement!!! Be careful about the time!	I like your way of presentation. Also, be careful about the time. Ask the important questions first. But generally good.	9	10	7	8	Good acting!	Good response to the lier one. Good that you maintained your character. I generally like your answers. Not very fighty yet interesting and defensive.  I good escape from impeachment using the money "he robbed."	Should object to the impeachment. Raise more objections. Improper character evidence saying that Bowman didn't tell Longstreet and accepted a meal. Badgering the witness objection when he keeps cutting into your witness's testimony.	Mrs. Bowman, you are a lier, aren't you? Loll. Good impeachment procedure. It's good that you sound firm and familiar with your witness's affidavit. You managed to control the witness very well.	8	7	7	8		If your attorney objected to a lack of personal knowledge, just answer I don't know. Say what the attorney would argue. You can always say I don't know for vague questions.	Be more confident.  "Call for speculation" or "Lack of personal knowledge" usually will be overruled. It's better to let the witness answer sorry I don't know. Be firm about your objections plzzzzzzzz.		8	8	8	8	Good action. And a good presentation of the story	I like your character hahaha. No need to argue too much about the 50%.	Don't be obsessed with not for the truth of the matter asserted. It's not hearsay because it's not a statement. It's a question. The same problem, don't object to speculation. Let the witness say I don't know. Your honor may I be heard.	a good analogy I think. Good questions on the 50% point.	8	A bit too slow. And not sure about the usefulness of the demo. Your closing sounds like an opening. There was too much storytelling, talking of the burden of proof and charge. Give more evidence.	9	A pretty strong beginning. Too much content on the slide. Good presentation and good tone.	31	41	154	163	155	160	164	159	156	167	t

153	6	- there is no clear narrative - the story doesn't have a clear theme and I got quite lost - bear in mind that judges may not have read the case package!\r\n- lacking burden of proof\r\n- no ending  - ended disruptively\r\n- Lacking pathos	7	- names just kept popping out. Who's Cameron P.?\r\n- bear in mind that judges may not have read the case package!\r\n- interesting analogy for the burden of proof	6	6	7	8	- it seems as if you are reading/reciting the script. Get some acting going!\r\n- lay more foundation before giving observations/suspicions	- didn't protect yourself from the credibility attack.	- the improper opinion objection battle - actually i feel like there's a bit of lack of foundation on how Longstreet got informed. \r\n- "it must be xxx" - lack of foundation \r\n-------cross------\r\nspeculation: the attorney can apparently ask what the witness thinks (this is not call for speculation) - the witness can easily answer "no".	- "it must be xxx" - should have switched to the ground of Lack of foundation. Everything argued by P attorney should be explained by the witness.\r\n-----cross------\r\n- good attacking on credibility\r\n- good familiarity with ROE\r\n- final few questions are quite strong	5	5	5	8	- with the first hearsay battle - your answer is already struck. please pay attention to the judge's ruling. You are technically not allowed to repeat your answer cuz it's hearsay.\r\n- "this is in my report" - lack of foundation - where is the report? when and how is the report is entered into evidence.	- didn't protect yourself on lacking evidence (fingerprint)\r\n- "I guess" - harms your credibility as an expert witness\r\n- don't have an expert character\r\n- "i'' use my brain, my feelings" - but you are a detective and here to testify for the prosecution.	- get familiar with hearsay ROE - \r\n"he told me that there are financial problems and ask whether I can do the job" \r\nand the answer that followed (fake tickets etc) - also clearly hearsay\r\n- if the witness is an expert witness, then these statements could be "Bases of an Expert’s Opinion Testimony" 703.\r\n- the table demo - laying foundation part - the counsel is testifying - the foundation should be testified by the witness, not you.\r\n\r\n- laying the foundation for the investigation doesn't make the report admissible - the STATEMENT IN THE REPORT is still out of court - still needs to find exceptions\r\n- get familiar with the expert witness ROE. Ask the WITNESS to lay the foundation for their expertise.	- the answer that followed the first hearsay objection battle (fake tickets etc) - the entire testimony was a direct quote from Longstreet - also clearly hearsay\r\n- good familiarity with ROE\r\n- Give the objection ground immediately after saying "objection your honour". e.g. "objection your honour, hearsay".	8	7	7	9	- where does the accent come from mate lol\r\n- could probably say mate or love a bit more haha\r\n- like the character	- consistent character and accent \r\n- being not sure or xx% sure harm your credibility	- compound question "did you see xxx and what xxx"\r\n- let your witness explain the exhibit	- love the opening of the cross\r\n- many objections/questions are quite spot on	7	6	7	6		"Bowman is my friend, I'm here to testify for him" - meaning that your testimony may be biased. Don't say that	- relevance has a low bar. I do consider what they testified is relevant.	- the first question is a bit out of nowhere - it's open-ended and the witness could go on and on about how he thinks bowman is trustworthy\r\n- when the witness says 'i'm here to testify for him', could have followed up to challenge the bias.	7	7	7	7	- why would you use a prison sell as the backdrop? You are technically in the courtroom as you speak\r\n- like that you are incorporating some acting in, but should practice acting a bit more - the crying bit is a bit dry\r\n- i wouldn't say it's wise to cry when you are trying to get yourself clear from the robbery charge - it just sounds a bit 歇斯底里 and also hard to actually hear what you were saying		- could have further elaborate on the waistband exhibit after it's entered. Or establish foundation -> enter exhibit -> explain the 'faded' part so that judges can directly tell the visual differences between the two waistbands	- like where you are going when asking the sequence of it's easy to operate, you've never made mistake, etc. to prove that it's intentional.	8	7	8	5	- love the outfit and background idea (though bear in mind you are technically in the courtroom as you speak). good character	- great that you haven't got misled by the opposing attorney on the management part	- could have called 'narrative' to disrupt the flow a bit. The witness was in full swing cuz she has a good story and character\r\n- (for the redirect) the judge has already told you "defence, you may proceed". no need to ask "your honour may i proceed".\r\n- A bit confused by the redirect question.	- misunderstanding of line 62-63 - that doesn't mean that the witness is aware of the management\r\n- familiarise yourself with hearsay objection, have a look at what 'party opponent' is	6	"for justice' sounds weak. The judge doesn't need a lecture on the current legal atmosphere in society...\r\n- charge is robbery 1 not just robbery - failed to meet the burden of proof - see jury instruction for robbery 1 and theft by deception\r\nmock trial is not just 空话 of the generic legal system and social order - where is the burden of proof\r\nP is not here to take up the burden for the whole society. You are here to meet the burden of proof. Solid proof is more valid than anything.	9	- like the storytelling rhythm for the 'trap' part\r\n- good that you mentioned the burden of proof, clearly following the jury instruction in the case pack\r\n- good that you linked back to the three keywords mentioned in opening,\r\n- i like how you constructed the closing around these three keywords. Easy to follow and good coherence.\r\n- good flip on what P argued in closing.	43	105	112	114	113	222	118	227	116	115	t
275	6	- Opening as the prosecution can be more structured (e.g. explicitly raising a few key questions/points that the jury should focus on in this trial). \r\n- Presentation is good, can have more variation in rhythm.	6	- Nice delivery.\r\n- The ending is a bit abrupt, could've slow down and come back to summarize your case with greater clarity.	5	4	5	8	- Some answers feel pretty scripted and not really natural (e.g. "how's your relationship with Bowman" "I didn't give him high salary")\r\n- Character is a bit insipid	- Can be more confident during cross.	- Can be more interactive with the witness during direct.	- Very confident and calm in objection battles, and can quickly change grounds based on opposing counsel's response.\r\n- Good cross with a series "you have not seen/witness ..." questions.	5	3	5	7	- Pretty confident. Showing good character at the beginning, should keep your character better even after long objection battles.	- Can be more confident and maintain your character during cross.\r\n- Can leverage your expert witness status more during cross.\r\n- Shouldn't just say "yes" when the opposing attorney accuses you of being contradictory to yourself.\r\n- Your fights are not really effective. Can be more confident in some cases and give up some unnecessary fights in other cases. "It's your goal that someone is punished for it, am I right?". You can just answer "No, but it's my job to uphold justice", etc.	- Asked a few improvised compound question (didn't get objection on these)\r\n- Can be more protective with your witness during cross (also can re-direct)	- Has a good understanding of ROE and invoked appropriate case law.	6	6	7	5	- Good character and interacts well with the attorney\r\n- Can you pull out your wallet in a real courtroom?	- Great maintaining your character.	- Good job invoking the case law and argue against hearsay.	- Can have a better fight with the hearsay objection.\r\n- Should not cut the witness off that often.	8	6	6	5	- Confident.	- Fights a bit too much, you just need to answer the question.	- You almost lost the hearsay objection by admitting that the statement is irrelevant to the case, but you managed to save it with further explanations and invoking 803(3)	- Good objection, but you can give more concrete response when the oppsoing counsel argues for then-existing mental, emotional or physical condition.	6	5	6	6	- Good presentation of the character. Can have more variation in your rhythm. It feels less affective if you always speak at the same pace.	- You agreed that the evidence 11b is an accurate copy but then proceeded with claiming that the photo may be scaled or incorrect.	- Good responses in the objection battle, demonstrating your understanding of ROE.	- Would be better that you break your questions down.	7	7	5	6	- Looks regretful and emotional.	- Good job maintaining the regretfulness in your cross.\r\n- Fights a bit too much.	- Can be more interactive with your witness. When your witness is crying and feeling guilty, you can give some reactions when appropriate instead of just keeping on asking more questions.	- You should ask more leading questions in your cross. You asked too many open-ended questions.	6	- Closing can more organized and structured towards emphasizing key points that show a concrete case beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n- Should have better time management to have a rebuttal.	7	- Good job echoing your opening statement.	65	113	67	63	210	203	62	66	204	64	t
139	8	I like your speech delivery style. You sound confident and you are good at relaying information. The  opening is very clear and well-structured, the only question I have is if you could elaborate in a few sentences in more concrete details what exactly the defendant did. You mentioned terrible crimes, stealing , lying, illegal activities, etc., but it would be helpful for the jury what exactly they did and why you are charging them on these counts since the opening is a preview of what we should be looking out for.	9	Very nice opening! I like your confidence and clarity in delivery. I really appreciate how you give us a brief description of what was happening at the beginning of your opening. I like that you laid out three questions for us to keep an eye out for. One small suggestion is to double check the grammar on the slides that you shared if you have time before the next rounds. In your theme by the way you might want to say "justice is missing" instead of "THE justice."	8	9	8	9	Your narrative is very clear and easy to follow, but sometimes points you might want to highlight got lost in your responses. I'm not sure if I came out with a clear understanding of what exactly happened between you and the defendant. \r\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, I do like that you are very passionate in the beginning. To make your performance more outstanding, I would suggest incorporating more body language and maintaining a more steady eye contact with the jury. I also like that you hesitate and think before your responses - very natural.	You navigated some tricky questions really well. You provided the right information but also maintained your stance.	You are good at directing your witness, but some of the questions could flow more smoothly.	Good objections. You raised important points in your cross examination.	9	8	8	10	You're actually pretty good at the accent haha. Good presentation, natural conversation, great body language, love the costume as well. You're really good at delivering information clearly as well. After your direct I have a clear idea of what was going on.	Good responses, but be careful of some inconsistencies in your response to the cross.	Natural flow of conversation, good direct. Good response to objections as well. Only thing is sometimes there were long pauses between your conversation with your witness and it would disrupt his flow a bit.	Good objections. For the cross - I like your confidence and clarity in delivery. Good line of questioning, great response to the witness, super natural flow of conversation. You made some really good points and pointed out some inconsistencies in the witness's statement.	8	9	9	8	Your narrative is relatively clear and easy to follow, but sometimes points you might want to highlight got lost in your responses.  I like that you have maintained steady eye contact with the jury, but I would suggest incorporating more body language to make your presentation more outstanding.	I like the way you answered the responses. Calm and confidence. You maintained your stance while giving adequate responses.	Great response to objections. Good flow of conversation with your witness. I know it's hard but if you could think of an additional question, try not to end with an objection because that looks bad for you and your witness.	You raise some really good objections for the direct. Sometimes your line of questioning during the cross could be clearer though. Some points got lost a little bit.	7	8	8	8	Your narrative is generally pretty easy to follow, but sometimes points you might want to highlight got lost in your responses. I like that you maintain steady eye contact with the jury and that you got very emotional at the end of your direct. It was really touching. I would suggest incorporating more body language if possible though.	Good responses to cross.	Natural flow of conversation, good direct. Good response to objections as well. \r\nI think your response to the impeachment was really good.	I really like the beginning of your cross. You had great flow, well-formulated questions, super clear line of questioning. You didn't leave a lot of space for your witness to argue, and that is perfect. You're really good at leading the witness. But then I felt your flow kind of got disrupted during the impeachments. I would say that sometimes it's better to rephrase the question and ask again than to impeach immediately. Impeachment is usually the lesser preferred option because it breaks the flow of your line of questioning. But I appreciate your assertiveness. I would also suggest not interrupting the witness because that looks bad for you.	8	8	10	8	Good accent and good uncle roger impression lol. Cracked me up. Be careful of enunciating clearly while you're doing the accent - you want to make sure we're able to understand you (we could for most cases but occasionally it might be hard to follow). Your narrative generally pretty easy to follow, but sometimes points you might want to highlight got lost in your responses. I'm not sure if I came out with a clear understanding of what exactly happened.	Good responses to cross.	Great line of questioning. Very smooth conversation. Great responses to objection.	Very exciting objection battle. I didn't really understand where a lot of your questions were leading though. The line of questioning could be clearer.	10	9	10	8	Great costume. Good impression. I like that you've spent so much effort into your presentation (and the background was amazing), and I love the way you dealt with the internet issue. In addition to good presentation, your responses provide really clear information on what was happening and you highlight a lot of great points.	Good responses to the cross. Love that you maintained your character while giving adequate information. The crossing attorney asked a lot of open-ended questions which gives you more liberty, and you could consider using these spaces to elaborate	Good line of questioning. You're great at leading and handling your witness.	Good line of questioning - you highlight some important points. When addressing objections, try not to engage directly with the opposing counsel. Just a friendly reminder that you might come off as a tiny bit aggressive/exasperated when you're responding to the opposing counsel & witness. Trying to stay calm during a cross is difficult, but it helps a lot!	8	Your speech delivery is great, but you sped up as you were going into the closing. I would suggest that you slow down so we can better understand you and so that the points that you would like to highlight do not get lost. I would also be careful about avoiding words like "I think" if you want to sound more formal and professional. Try to use something like "the defense believes that." \r\nAbsolutely LOVED your rebuttal. That was really good and straight to the point.	9	I like that you recalled the theme in the closing. Your speech delivery and pacing is great, and I love that you incorporate body language. Your main points for the closing are that there is no intention. Intention is hard to prove and even though the burden of proof is not on you if would be nice if you could substantiate your argument with some facts, which you started to do.	29	163	148	150	149	141	151	136	153	152	t
294	4	PRETRIAL (unscored): I like "good day" - that's clever. Sally was too close to the camera and Hunter was too far on introductions. Aside from that, you made a nice impression on pretrial. You need to cut out UHs from your vocabulary. If you're going to share case law, explain why it matters--how it connects to what you intend to prove--otherwise, we don't know what's going on with it and it wastes our time.\r\n\r\nOPENING: "He turned off the lights; he hides all his lies." You want your tenses to agree--"turned" is past tense, and "hides" is present. Good storytelling. What the heck is the Tunnel of Terror? (I know what it is, but you should never use a proper name without explaining what you're referring to.) You're over-gesticulating with one arm. Use your eyebrows more to convey emotion. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the theme is that you didn't really explain any lies in the narrative - just the violence.  Remember genders; you can't say "he" and then suddenly say "her/she." \r\n\r\nit's odd to explain complicity in the middle of the 'three things you're going to prove.' I feel like you jumped from a roadmap to the burden section and back to the burden. Structurally, it felt off. \r\n\r\nIf you're going to do a "three point" structure for your witnesses, walk from one side to the other and then center (point one, two, three).\r\n\r\nOverall, you're a worthy final round competitor and you fit well in PPMT's tradition of strong final round openers.  I just don't think this is a clear story.\r\n\r\nIf time is up, stop talking. I'm going to mark you down the more you go overtime.\r\n\r\nThey've called time on you twice in the chat and once verbally. This strongly hurt you.	8	PRETRIAL (unscored): You need to be friendlier at the start--this is your time to make a positive impression, and you look somewhat over-serious. I also don't think you're paying attention to the judge; he asked for objections, and you invoked 603/615.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to share case law, explain why it matters--how it connects to what you intend to prove--otherwise, we don't know what's going on with it and it wastes our time.\r\n\r\nOPENING: "The real defendant isn't here." First, it's opposing COUNSEL, not COUNSELS. I think your theme isn't 'punchy' enough - I think something like "the wrong person's in the defendant's chair; the real criminal's still out there" could help supplement it. Good public speaking. \r\n\r\n"All he did was look out for his friend" - that makes it seem like he was trying to HELP his friend. That hurts your narrative.\r\n\r\nYour gestures feel constrained to me. \r\n\r\nReasonable doubt isn't 100% certainty. That's misstating. Most legal scholars say it's 98-99%, because "possible doubt" can still exist.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, you should probably screen-share them so I can see them (if your competition allows).\r\n\r\nUrgh, I just hate the three-witness structure for witnesses. It's just not particularly compelling. I think there are much better three-part ways to preview your story and I look forward to seeing you do it.\r\n\r\nI like your theme integration. I find it effective. It's growing on me.\r\n\r\nWhy does it matter that Charlie Kaminsky has a 'free spirit?' \r\n\r\nIt would have been much better to use the three questions as your three points - each witness suggests a 'question' with their testimony.\r\n\r\nYou easily out-scored by staying on time.	6	6	7	5	I think you're a likable witness.  But your answers feel very forced. "I'll buy you a milkshake!" It makes you more of a 'greedy capitalist' type who wants more sign-ups at all costs, which costs you credibility.  Your background isn't suggestive of anything in particular to me.\r\n\r\nYou said the defendant still works for you, and then said he hasn't worked for you for 2 years. Really focus on tense agreement.\r\n\r\nThe joke about "nothing happened' was kind of funny - but why would something happen? He's a low-level employee. That would certainly violate HR standards. \r\n\r\nYou seem too childish as this goes on. You're a CEO and businesswoman and you're coming across like a kid on the "scream" answer.\r\n\r\nWho's Haley Floyd? And "Kimball went towards" - who's Kimball? Don't introduce characters without explaining who they are as the first witness.	Overall, you come across as likable and didn't lose your credibility - this feels like the same person on CX as it was on DX.\r\n\r\n"Longstreet knows a lot of people" - why refer to yourself like that? This feels new.	Hunter, you should consider not pausing between questions to smack your lips. I find you a little far away from the screen relative to the other attorneys. Don't say "yes your honor" in response to procedurals - it just slows things down. "Yes, Ms. Longstreet" felt awkward.  I think your 'banter with the witness' feels fake to me - "that's very kind" felt hackneyed.  Work on your vocal inflection - you go REALLY HIGH sometimes and the sound is warping for me.  The structure of this direct isn't punchy enough...you're taking SO LONG to get to Bowman. We're now several minutes in and we're still not on the defendant.\r\n\r\nGood recovery after the wifi issue.\r\n\r\nThe 'banter' with Longstreet is becoming distracting.\r\n\r\nStop commenting on the witness's answers, please.\r\n\r\nEnd of the direct fizzled out.\r\n\r\nDefend your witness if they're cut off.\r\n\r\nWhile I didn't like your banter with your witness, I liked it with your judge.\r\n\r\nSAY THE NAME OF THE OBJECTION! You need GROUNDS! That would be "badgering."\r\n\r\nGood hearsay/403 objection. You sound good on it. +1 points for it.	I don't find your camera angle compelling. You're very close. I can't see any gestures. You probably had weeks to plan out everything about your presentation - I would expect a higher standard.\r\n\r\nDon't cut the witness off so soon - you haven't earned that level of aggression. \r\n\r\nI want a more targeted header at the start of this CX so I know why this profit/loss sheet matters - it doesn't connect to the theory from your opening.\r\n\r\nDid you move that into evidence? I may have missed it if you did.\r\n\r\nSome of these questions are compound/introducing too much information.\r\n\r\nI don't see you dealing with the witness's emotions, or embodying the emotion of the testimony you're creating. This all feels the same to me.\r\n\r\nMiddle of the cross felt very effective. Your content was substantially better than your delivery in this case., though I didn't understand the relevance of the first pocket (profit/loss).\r\n\r\nGood hearsay response, but I didn't feel as compelled by your 403 response. I want you to phrase that much more strongly.\r\n\r\nEnding fizzled out.	8	8	7	6	I love your speaking voice! You sound fantastic in this role.  I appreciate the background/costume, too.\r\n\r\nIt's odd to keep referring to the attorney as "Ms. Lu." It doesn't feel natural. The more you do it, the more scripted it feels.\r\n\r\n"Racheter Park" - I think it's "RacheterWorld."\r\n\r\nI feel like you're going too fast (when you got to the phone segment). You now feel rushed to me.\r\n\r\nYou're flipping your hair a lot--nothing wrong with that, but it signifies nervousness.	Good job keeping professionalism.\r\n\r\nI don't see even a hint of emotion regarding Thomas. That feels slightly off-base. But you're not losing any ground.	Odd question about "what made you an officer", but everything else in the background section was compelling. "Those are some awards I earned" should probably get a "record reflect the witness gestured with trophies." Otherwise, it'll show up weirdly in transcripts.\r\n\r\nBy calling her "Miss" as opposed to "Detective," you undermine her credibility. \r\n\r\nI think you do a good job fading in the background here - but I would like it if you looped more answers to emphasize key facts. \r\n\r\nWhy are we talking about Jackie Hunter? Who cares about undermining Jackie Hunter? This is messing up the flow of the P case. We're now halfway done with the second witness, and we've barely talked about the death. \r\n\r\nGood 703 initial response, even though I don't really buy the connection - you're just trying to knife Hunter. The second response should have knocked it out of the park.\r\n\r\nWhy are we not screen-sharing the texts?\r\n\r\n"To the best of your knowledge, what is your take?" That's a very oddly-worded question.	Kimball should NOT be certified as an expert in financial crime investigation. Where's Kimball's CV?  Kimball didn't provide that to the court. This reflects some meta-knowledge I have of the case, but that's a big strategic misstep. You could've made them look really bad if you fought that.\r\n\r\nDon't say "I believe" - just state it as fact. You're saying "I believe" all the time. Your arguments are good, but you're undermining them with your rhetorical framing.\r\n\r\nYour camera angle here, just like that of your colleague, is awkward.  Is this the best/most optimal angle to showcase your public speaking?\r\n\r\nIs the D argument that Floyd/Longstreet are suspects? If so, where was that in openings? I don't know how to filter the information you're giving me.\r\n\r\nYou are far too stoic in your approach. I don't see even a hint of emotion on the Thomas death; the purpose of it is framing what we should imagine the witness's emotions are.\r\n\r\nI don't hear you using a variety of control techniques. Ultimately, it feels like the witness is getting away with a lot.\r\n\r\nEnd of cross was rhetorically effective.	7	7	5	6	I like your enthusiastic delivery. That's fun. But I wish I had more of a character to you beyond "loud and high energy." I would like fewer words, more pauses, and more actual jokes. \r\n\r\n"Pretty easy, right" felt really fake. It's indicative of the biggest problem with this witness as a whole - there's a degree of friendliness, but it feels a bit hackneyed and canned. I'm going to challenge you to do your lines in a way that doesn't feel like you're trying to cram each segment full of content. I found it a little exhausting. Find more dynamics.	I like that you respond to headers. I think that's good.  But slow down. \r\n\r\nI find you responsive. This feels like the same person from direct. \r\n\r\nI like your background!	I can't see your camera feed at all. Ah, good recovery. I appreciate that. I won't mark you down for it.\r\n\r\nI have the same comment about over-gesticulating with one hand. from opening. \r\n\r\nI don't think I love the flow of these P witnesses. It doesn't seem chronological. I'm just not sure of the order.\r\n\r\nI think I wanted more of an inflection/tonal shift between the number of times the defendant messed with the ride.\r\n\r\nYou forgot to say your grounds for "hearsay." \r\n\r\nYour fluency is lacking on objection responses. Slow down. No UHs.\r\n\r\nYou're over-objecting now. It just cost you a point.	Be a bit more confident on the objection responses - you feel too sedate.\r\n\r\nNo objection to the statement that "everyone knows you shouldn't touch the level" - huh?\r\n\r\nAsk to be heard when you object. But did that speculation to the 'boyfriend' thing matter at all? Who cares about Longstreet's boyfriend?\r\n\r\nAgain, camera angle issues. I'll stop commenting on them for your attorneys--but this is really sub-optimal. \r\n\r\nI think you can slow down just a little bit and be more presentational here. You got into a bit of a debate breath cadence during your objection responses.\r\n\r\nDon't say "YES YOUR HONOR" in response to rulings - just moved in.\r\n\r\nOverall, the lack of clear argumentative headers here means that I'm just not solid about your argument.\r\n\r\nStop saying "would you like to answer my question" - she has no choice. And she's not being fighty enough to merit that passive-aggressive claim.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you asked me to repeat the three major questions you asked at the start, or what your core case theory was, I just wouldn't be able to tell you it. Conspiracy? But conspiracy to do what?\r\n\r\nTry not to chuckle on objection responses. Good response to relevance, but don't say "I don't see WHY" - it's not up to what you see or not.\r\n\r\nWhy are these questions being asked in this order? I don't really get it. End on your strongest point.\r\n\r\nSMART loop on 'catastrophic mistake.' But the lack of body language when you're describing things like "running towards" just makes this less compellling.	6	5	6	6	There's something about your location - I suppose everyone's in the same room - but I can't give you more points for the use of a good background.\r\n\r\nI like your general style, but what is the--Kennedy thing? Are you asserting you're part of a United States political dynasty? It feels like an odd choice to me.\r\n\r\nIt's Lyndon Baines Johnson, not Lyndon Boyd Johnosn.\r\n\r\nYou're going for too much here. There isn't a clear narrative here coming out of your crosses and narratives on "suspicious things" that are itemized, so this feels weird.\r\n\r\nI like the "god opens a window" joke.\r\n\r\nStop talking when there's an objection.\r\n\r\nYou're basically doing the same tone/emotion throughout the examination.	You can't cut yourself off ("I'm a Kennedy and yeah"). I wish you could have stuck the landing with a real joke there.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I wish you kept the Kennedy thing up more effectively - with some clever punch-line or response.\r\n\r\nYou felt like you lost a bit of credibility on cross.	You need to use your face - eyebrows and mouth - to be more expressive. You seem quite blank.\r\n\r\nI hate the "tell more about yourself" - it's a vague question. You can be more targeted.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Miss Hunter" - stop commenting on witness answers.\r\n\r\nIt's funny. In most rounds, Hunter feels totally irrelevant. In this round, because the P focused so much on the TBD, your Hunter feels more relevant.\r\n\r\nFinally, a gesture on 'four suspicious things.' Better that than nothing. But, on the whole, you're not expressive enough here.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I suppose the structure of this feels easy to follow. But I don't understand how they prove the defense's theory. I want to understand where you're going with it before the closing.\r\n\r\nBad asked and answered objection. That's standard cross control.	You know, I'd give you a lot of points if you just asked, like, "Did you consider that you could have been fired for constantly talking about the Kennedys?" \r\n\r\nI wish there was a joke about "Ms. Hunter" v. "Hunter Wang."\r\n\r\nStop saying AND at the start of questions.\r\n\r\nI wish you spent more time establishing that the witness is not relevant to this case. Hunter doesn't know anything about the robbery - nothing at all. You're spending  a lot of time on a witness that doesn't matter - and the bias isn't hitting.\r\n\r\nThe witness listed a number of items that were suspicious. A better cross would've gone after the same things in the same order. Would've felt spontaneous.	9	8	9	9	Heh--was that planned? I found it fun. I LOVE the Charlie Kaminsky joke at the start. You won me over.\r\n\r\nHeh - makes it luxurious. This character is ridiculous, but it's a shot of energy that really woke me up in this trial.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast joke hit for me.  I don't want this ballot to indicate every witness should behave like this - but I like that you did it. You have a charisma I wished others did. The lack of good background/costume keeps it from a 10 for me, but it's fun.	Good response on fake bracelet.\r\n\r\nYou did a good job keeping the energy up without being annoying - but I wish you had something fun, like you had on direct.	This is the first time I liked the banter - "That's fantastic" hit my funny bone. On the whole, the camera angle is still awkward and you can work on facial expressions so you look like you care more.\r\n\r\nThis witness does a good job proving conspiracy for you.\r\n\r\nThe lack of dynamic presentation is hurting you; you're still too constrained. But I love your witness and your direct didn't undermine him.\r\n\r\nI like how you stopped your witness for the objection.\r\n\r\nDon't say it's a brief redirect - take the time you need.\r\n\r\nDon't say I BELIEVE in response to objections. I don't think you had full cover on 803-2. It's tough to do excited utterance here.\r\n\r\nThe bar thing was compelling.\r\n\r\nSMART REDIRECT! +1 point.	Good hearsay objection - well-timed.\r\n\r\nI think "he and his friends are taking away money" was good. Overall, this is a good 'damning quote' character witness cross. Thus far, this is the best cross in the round. It could be better with more looping and showmanship. \r\n\r\nNice and concise - at long last!\r\n\r\nThis was, by far, the best triangle of the whole trial.	7	5	6	7	Your gestures are theatrical but it seems disconnected from your face, which is not expressive. I like your shirt! Good costume.\r\n\r\nI don't fully buy your acting on "I swear this is Cameron!" Your emotion disappears as soon as you answers end. You have to be consistent.\r\n\r\nYou were doing well during the dramatic answer - but it was objected to. You need to objection-proof your dramatic moments so you don't lose your momentum.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the attempt at emotion, but your attorney's un-emotive demeanor makes it hard for me to take your emotion seriously.	You're very compliant here - maybe too compliant. Your emotion isn't that compelling. I don't buy it - the affect is so flat. \r\n\r\n"Overwhelmed, panicked" - that doesn't sound like a witness who has been overwhelmed and panicked.\r\n\r\nI hate "I don't see the connection" - that's so lawyer-like and argumentative. \r\n\r\nOdd for you to say Cameron is "quite smart." A compliment towards the criminal isn't helpful.	Again, I hate the "tell us a little about yourself." You have an impassive-looking face here - like you don't care at all about your client. I need more expressiveness. \r\n\r\nI wish Exhibit 9 had been used earlier in the trial! The lack of clear questions and exhibits being looped consistently throughout the trial detriments both sides.\r\n\r\nYour tone not changing at all through the Cameron Poole = bad questions harms the flow of the exam.\r\n\r\nI think the story was clear here, but I don't see any connection to the core of your defense (which is conspiracy).\r\n\r\n"Can you finish your answer" is ineffective without you looping where we were. I totally forgot where we were.\r\n\r\nThe defendant direct needs a climax; you're just not giving me the emotion to make it a climax.\r\n\r\nI like "Cameron Poole isn't here" at the end. Cool ending.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to object argumentative, you should do it much sooner.\r\n\r\nAll the foundation wasn't there for this impeachment. You should have objection hearsay. That was eventually objected to - but it was super untimely.	I like your strategic objection in the middle of the dramatic answer. Objection, grounds, may I be heard should be your formula. Read your judge; he's been asking for the objection basis from every witness.\r\n\r\nI want more use of eyebrows/expressions.\r\n\r\nGood "I didn't ask you how you felt." I thought that was good - felt like solid cross control.\r\n\r\nI like "was there an objection" here. Nice job. Felt polite.\r\n\r\nYou lost fluency on the "agree with me" segments.\r\n\r\nOh my lord, you're now arguing with the witness! Remember the classic 10 commandments of cross-examination - one of them is don't quarrel. \r\n\r\nYour "you lied"  questions are effective.  And he's just giving you these answers. I'd normally ask you to go after conspiracy theory stuff here by using him to confirm the Kaminsky cross - but he didn't go after that on his own direct.\r\n\r\nGood use of the text messages - but why weren't they there on the Kimball direct? I hate that I'm only seeing it here for the first time.\r\n\r\nAll the foundation wasn't there for this impeachment. it was messy. It cost you a point.	7	Good delivery, good understanding of mock trial fundamentals. Your focus on Thomas doesn't mirror your case, which barely focused on Thomas's injury. Your case over-focused on theft by deception, IMO, which is the lower and less dramatic/compelling charge. There are so many charges that some kind of demo seems necessary for me. \r\n\r\nI wish you had a physical speaker's triangle to show you know how to move strategically - you seem too stiff. \r\n\r\nI have the same problem with your closing structure as I do with the opening structure - it's like theme, narrative, crimes, complicity, and then witnesses. You finished your explanation of complicity with 4 minutes left - that's more than half of your time before you got  there. That's not enough time on substance. And now I've lost track of structure. What if you spent your 'burden' section on complicity, and then made each of your points the three crimes? Wouldn't that make sense?\r\n\r\nYou have a 'aaahhhhh, what a myssstery' kind of pausing technique. I don't mind it, but I wanted a real climax/moment of passion in the closing.\r\n\r\nI like the impeachment reference.\r\n\r\nWhy are you spending so much time on Hunter? I don't even think that's the crux of the D argument, which is about the weird bar meeting/conspiracy. Feels like a strawman; take the D at their HIGHEST ground.\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo win closings, you need to win the defense's three questions.\r\n\r\nYup...you didn't. Okay. Didn't feel responsive.	8	You need more gesture commitment; you kind of throw up your hands, semi-extended, but you're not really bringing it.\r\n\r\nI like your twist on the defendant thing. Feels fresh enough, I guess. I wish you had more theme integration.\r\n\r\nI wish you had told me more of a narrative that tied up your conspiracy argument. That's your big point and your theme really doesn't touch on it. \r\n\r\nYour facial expressions are pretty blank - you should be over-expressive. \r\n\r\nI like that you brought back the three questions (a demo would have been nice, if you're allowed to have it). But your three questions do not match the case you put on, which is almost totally about the conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nGood speaker's triangle.\r\n\r\nI think the accounting record point is just bad. Why wouldn't I want to have multiple records as a back up? The overall narrative here is "some things seem shady and some things don't." I don't get how it exonerates Bowman. Take the P at their highest ground. Go after the Kaminsky evidence.\r\n\r\nTrying to claim your client isn't a liar is kind of weak. He admitted to lying a ton on CX.\r\n\r\nI like "complicity is a two way street" but I wish you refocused it on Longstreet. \r\n\r\nGood ending to question 2.\r\n\r\nThis has better time allocation and better moments than the P closing, though I marginally prefer the P delivery.	77	139	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t

"You are going to hear that..."	7	6	6	8	There were a couple moments in your direct when you just ended your response abruptly. "It was strange -- and then the attorney asks what was strange. In an actual conversation, people don't usually stop at the point "it was strange". This is a little "mocky". But other than that, I can see the effort you put in to develop your character. Try to incorporate a few more jokes into your direct to keep the direct engaging.	"Yes, if you want to" -- Just say yes. I don't think they are trying to blame you for making that mistake. You don't have to fight on this.\r\n\r\nBe more agreeable on cross. There's no reason for you to become so hostile toward the opposing counsel on cross. You don't have a stake in this case. You don't really care whether or not the prosecution wins the case. So just agree with most of the questions they are asking. Save your explanation for the important questions only. If you fight too much, it will cost all the credibility you built up during direct.	Good response to the hearsay objection. You can be a little more concise and just say "This is not hearsay because it's admission by party opponent"\r\n\r\nLook through the direct to make sure you know all the arguments you wanna make if they object. They did catch you off guard with the second and third hearsay objection. You can try to argue that you are not using it for the truth, but for the effect on the listener.\r\n\r\nTry to avoid 403 objection. It has such a high bar that I don't think the judge is going to ever sustain the objection on 11a.	Good hearsay objection second time around. Good catch on 8031 and 8036 and how the statement don't fall under those.\r\n\r\nVery good control of the witness. Watch out for your hand gestures. You are using really similar hand gestures for every question. Mix up different hand gestures based on what the question is about.	8	7	7	6	I like how committed you are to this character. Really love the character\r\n\r\n"I mean they only have two buttons" -- you can add a joke about how zoom has so many buttons and it is very confusing. You still couldn't figure out after your grandson taught you over and over again. But tunnel of terror, it ONLY has TWO buttons!\r\n\r\nGood recovery that her work performance became worse and worse	Your accent changed a little in cross. Make sure you practice getting crossed to make the accent consistent	Don't cut your witness off.\r\n\r\nBe more patient with your witness hahahahaha. She's taking the time to answer the questions. Give her a pause before you jump on to the next question.\r\n\r\nHearsay on "it was cameron poole who..." on cross	Good speculation objection. The second one is a little too petty about the work attitude. You don't have to thank the judge for making a ruling.\r\n\r\nYou also don't have to thank the witness for giving an answer you want. Just ask your next question.\r\n\r\nA question doesn't have any truth value <-- this should be should be your argument responding to hearsay. Don't end your cross on an objection. Have a backup pocket just in case you got an objection sustained like in this case. You are doing a really good job on your cross.	6	8	8	6	Try to find a place with better wifi for the competition. It's 100% not your fault for having a tech issue. But this kind of influence how well we can judge your performance. Make sure you have this kind of tech issue resolved before the next round starts.	VERY GOOD "That's incorrect" response! This is exactly when you should just give a clear "that's incorrect". The opposing counsel doesn't really know how to follow up on that and asked you an open-ended question instead. Then you took the opportunity to explain your case!	You are handling the tech issues really well. It's the little details like this that show the judge you are professional and confident. But watch out for your facial expression when we are waiting for the witness. You are kinda laughing at your phone or something and we can see that from the screen\r\n\r\nYou can't comment on what the witness says. Be careful with saying "That's terrible". Just ask the questions directly.\r\n\r\nGood hearsay response to exhibit 5. You laid out the argument really clear for the green boxes and the gray boxes. I'm wondering if you were there for the Q&A session yesterday cuz this argument was really really good.	You are doing a good job making objections. Try not to withdraw your objection. For exhibit 5 specifically, pick a statement you want to object to instead of the entirety. \r\n\r\n"Could you explain?", "Can you show..." --> don't ask open ended questions on cross. \r\n\r\nMake sure that your cross is structured in a way that the witness has to agree with you. If they disagree, there should be a way to impeach the witness directly\r\n\r\nGreat response to the LOF objection! That's how you should argue every objection!	7	6	6	7	Decent direct all around. Same thing with the cliff hanger. There were a few moments where you just ended the response abruptly. "It was strange" without saying what what strange. \r\n\r\nI would love to see a few more jokes on direct about your job, your background to make the direct more engaging. You are doing a good job	Good cross demeanor overall. Watch out for the "Well" at the beginning of your responses. You like to say that at every response.\r\n\r\nBe familiar with your affidavit. You sort of lost your confidence when they tried to impeach you. And this does feel like a direct contradiction. You did fine through most of the cross. Stay confident even if you do get impeached.	Good response to the LOF objection the second time! Nice recovery from the first one.  Good response to speculation. The phrase you are looking for in that response is "Rational based perception"	Good LOF foundation. Watch out for your body language when you are objecting. You seem to be a little too casual during objection when you just had your hand on the side of your face. Stay professional.\r\n\r\nHold up finger for 2 buttons and 1 maintenance lever. Also break this into two questions. "There are only 2 buttons" "There's only ONE maintenance lever" since your whole case is based on the fact the the control is\r\n\r\nDon't overuse the term "client". The prosecution represents the government. They don't have a client in the case. Just call the witness by their name. "Ms. Haley" for example.\r\n\r\nMake sure you run through the impeachment process before next round. You need to first have the witness authenticate the affidavit. you remember preparing an affidavit prior to the trial today --> you swear to tell the truth --> you are under the same oath today --> you had up to opening statement today to make any change --> you'd be able to recognize your affidavit if I show it to you --> Let the record reflect I'm screensharing Ms. Hunter's affidavit on the screen -->"This is your affidavit" --> That's your name on the top --> that's your signature at the bottom --> This is a fair and accurate copy --> Please read along silently while I'm reading it out loud [READ THE SENTENCE] --> Did I read it correctly	9	8	7	8	I CAN DEFINITELY SEE YOUR PASSION. I like your character a lot. You are really passionate. And that translates into you are acting.\r\n\r\nInstead of saying the I don't have a kid line, I think you can try to come up with another joke for going to the amusement park so often.	You did a really good job at the beginning of the cross to stay engaged. But toward the end you	Good 8033 response. Good job sticking your ground with this is a plan not a statement of memory.	Good cross demeanor overall. You are handling a really funny witness. And you made her lost her character a little toward the end of the cross	6	5	8	8	It seems like you are reading from a script. You need to look at the camera more. Your facial expression was a little indifferent when you are responding to questions. Your whole life is dependent on this trial. Make sure you sound like you care a lot.\r\n\r\nYou are not looking at the camera at all when you are responding --> This reflects	Be CONFIDENT during cross\r\n\r\nThere are bad facts that you have to fight a little. You are giving everything the prosecution is asking you. Be familiar with what are the things you need to agree on and what are the things you can say no to.	I really like how you are asking the questions. You sound like you care about what the witness has to say. Watch out for the "So" at the beginning of the questions.\r\n\r\nRead the judge's ruling. I have overruled almost all the speculation/LOPK objections during cross examination by saying that "This is cross examination, if the witness doesn't know, she can just say I don't know." --> That said, think about whether you want to object speculation or not\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL IS TESTIFYING --> The opposing counsel was commenting on what the witness was saying.	You can say "Point of order your honor, may I ask Ms. Bowman to speak up a little? I couldn't really hear her" when you are trying to ask the judge to have the witness speak up a little\r\n\r\nIf the judge asks you a question, don't get scared. Answer the question directly cuz usually that's the information that the judge needs. For example in this case I ask you to clarify what foundation you think is lacking here, then you can just go ahead and say the foundation that's lacking. Turn on your camera when you are objecting.\r\n\r\nTurn on the camera when you are performing anything. Your facial expression, body movements, hand gestures are all very important to your performance. Don't worry about lagging, if we cannot hear you, we will let you know.\r\n\r\nWatch out for the "Is it fair to say..." cuz sometimes the witness can just disagree with your "big" questions. Make sure you know how to deal with the witness if they disagree with you.\r\n\r\n"That's nice" -- DO NOT COMMENT ON THE WITNESS's ANSWER. \r\n\r\nDon't say "Last question". This would be a sign for the other side to object.	6	Great opening. I like your tone a lot. Use your hands to help with your presentation. When you are talking about 1,2,3 --> use your hands to show 1,2,3\r\n\r\nYou sound really passionate during your entire closing which is good! To make it to the next level, think about how to vary your tone. There could be moments where you get louder and louder. There could also be moments where you drop your volume to make it dramatic.	8	YOUR TONE IS AMAZING. The pacing is great overall too. Watch out for the use of hand gestures. You are moving your hand based on the syllabus you are saying.\r\n\r\nVery good explanation on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubts!\r\n\r\nTry stand up when you are giving the statement. You are doing a good job delivering the closing with the variations in your tone. Plan some movements throughout your closing to signify to the jury that you are moving in between points. It's hard for the jury to focus for 9 mins if that's just you speaking at the camera. Incorporate the movements to make the closing more engaging.	35	143	171	49	173	54	169	53	52	50	t
187	7	- Organization of the opening is good. Storytelling is strong. The overall delivery has a good rhythm. \r\n- A bit too emotional as prosecution.\r\n- A bit too theatrical turning the lights on and offf as it would only work in Zoom.	4	- It's a good story but the delivery needs to be more attractive.	5	6	6	4	- Sometimes overplay the question the attorney asked (narrative).	- Maintains the character pretty well throughout the cross.	- A clear understanding of rules of evidence.\r\n- Transition between questions are not so smooth, try to be more responsive to what the witness is answering instead of just getting information from her.	- The objection of ultimate issue is a bit problematic.\r\n- Feeling a bit lost in objection battles.	5	5	6	5	- Gives a feeling of reciting/reading a script. Needs improve on "talking" as a witness.	- Fights a bit too much and should be more cooperative. But good at keeping the character.	- Overall solid but apparently there isn't too much to fight on this witness/objection battles.	- Could've been a bit more aggressive and emphasize more with language (volume, tone, etc.) on questions that matter the most. Overall a bit plain.	7	8	6	5	- Pretty eloquent and has a good demeanor.	- Very solid, does not (over)fight the opposing counsel. Feeling confident and calm.	- Overall looking professional.	- Looks a bit too mild during cross.	4	3	3	7	- Character is a bit weak.	- Does not clarify when the crossing attorney misinterpret the answer.\r\n- Keep saying "I can't remember" does not help.	- Asked a leading question, gets objected, and skipped it.\r\n- Gives up objection battles too easily / does not understand improper character evidence well.	- Good objections.\r\n- Good understanding of the rules of evidence.\r\n- "I take that as a yes" while the witness answers no.\r\n- The impeachment feels a bit weird because you cannot disprove a witness "can't remember something" by showing that they do not mention that they "can't remember" in their affidavit because an affidavit is about something that the witness is capable of testifying to. However, if you can indicate where the witness showed that she does remember the content it would've been a good impeachment.	4	5	4	7	- Lack of character.	- Could be a bit stronger against an aggressive crossing attorney.	- Needs to improve on the understanding of character evidence and provide better responses against objections.\r\n- Missed the chance of re-direct.	- Good objections, and very clear explanations of the grounds of objections.\r\n- A bit too aggressive.	5	3	5	6	- Looks regretful during direct.	- Should be more cooperative with the opposing counsel.	- Needs to have a better understanding of rules of evidence especially with regards to objections.\r\n- Could have some moer interactions with the witness.	- Have a few objections when it is not necessary to do so.\r\n- Fighting with the witness too much.	6	- Very clear and well-organized closing by appealing to the questions raised in the opening.\r\n- Good rebuttal pointing out character evidence.\r\n- Rebuttal should be more focused on the defense's closing instead of just continuing with your script. You can reiterate on certain important things, but do spend more time on what the defense closing had argued.	5	- Pretty good appeal to emotions, but can be more affective.\r\n- Defense side doesn't have rebuttal.	58	113	48	44	43	222	46	45	47	224	t

288	10	- I didn't quite catch the last word in your theme.\r\n- You give a very clear and concise summary of what happened in your opening statement, you lay out clearly which issues are at stake here, and you give a good overview of what we should be looking out for. \r\n- Great preparation, great coordination with the screen share - I'm very impressed.	10	- Simple and clear theme. I like it. \r\n- Great presentation, great delivery. Your pacing is great and I like your eye contact & body language. \r\n- You highlight some great points in your opening: which issues are at stake, what we should be looking out for, etc. \r\n- You said the real defendant had "teammates" but I would say "co-conspirators" to drill in the point.	8	8	9	10	- I realized you put on the commanding officer costume. That's funny. Sometimes your Russian accent sounds southern though, like from Texas or Missouri or something.\r\n- I like that you maintained eye contact, but I would incorporate more body language and weave in pauses/hesitations/changes of tone and pace during your narrative to make it more varied and natural. \r\n- Great, concise direct.	- Some of the questions you could give the cross attorney a harder time by not agreeing directly.	- Good direct of your witness, great response to objections. \r\n- This is a small personal thing but a trick to make your direct sound more natural instead of more rehearsed you can try lowering your pitch a bit, and try not to end your sentence as if you're asking a question.\r\n- During the re-direct you asked about the person looking like Cameron Poole but I think the bigger issue that the defense attorney won is that it's so easy to mistake the buttons and your witness did that once as well under a situation less stressful. I would ask for clarification on that.	- I like that you are very calm during your cross, when handling the witness and when responding to objections.\r\n- I think you already made your point very clear when you show us that both of the buttons are on the bottom right quarter. You don't necessarily need a response from the witness. The judges can see your point - it's well made. \r\n- Great line of questioning. You made your point very very clear.	8	8	8	8	- I like that you built up a character but it would help if you knew your script a bit better to avoid the hesitations mid-sentence.	- I like that you maintained your character during the cross.	- Good direct.	- I'm not a big fan of interrupting witnesses. I think you ask some good questions and I would have more confidence that your line of questioning can show us your point without having to interrupt your witness.	9	8	9	8	- I love your eye contact and body language. Good direct with great information.	- Some of the questions you can argue a bit with the attorney, like when she asked if it's true no one mentioned Bowman during the investigation, etc. I would say something like "this is actually really natural in the primary investigation phase, in my x years of experience, it is a bit rash to exclude any suspect at this stage based on blahblah.." Use your experience and expertise.	- You are good at leading your witness and answering objections.	- I like that you are very calm in handling the witness and asking questions. \r\n- Some of your questions weren't super effective in my opinion, like holding someone accountable or being devastated. These are normal responses and you might need other foundations to establish your point.	8	8	9	8	- Your direct is pretty straightforward and clear. In terms of presentation if you want to take it to the next level, I would spend some time on costumes, props, inventing a character. Using more body language and changes of pitch/tone/voice level, pausing in sentences and speeding up, to create some more dynamics.	-  Some of the questions you can argue a bit with the attorney, give them a harder time.	- You are good at leading your witness and answering objections.	- I like that you are very calm in handling the witness and asking questions. \r\n- Your cross is very concise but I feel like some of the questions you could build up a bit more to drill in the point.	10	9	10	10	- LOVE the energy and the well-drafted beginning. Attention-gripping. The body language was great too. \r\n- The information you relayed during your direct was very effective as well.	- I like that you maintained your personality during the cross. Some of the questions maybe you could try to argue a bit. Because you're such a character judges will probably give you some credit for being less cooperative.	- I love YOUR energy too. I love the way your calmness works with the bombastic persona of your witness. \r\n- You presented a very interesting narrative with your witness.	- If I were you, I would say something in the beginning of the cross to control the witness. I might say something like  "Ok Mr. Kaminsky -  I know this is your first time in court and you're very excited, but could you calm down for me so we can put our heads together and figure out what is going on?"  Just to curb the energy so he doesn't keep taking the spotlight. \r\n- Short, concise cross.	10	9	9	9	- I like the special touch about the dinosaur comic. I also like that you emphasized you often have to calm your friend down. Overall I've realized that the defense's case is very coherent. All the witnesses contribute to the same narrative and I love that. And you especially help with your direct. \r\n- You are a very convincing witness.\r\n- Some of your responses stop in the middle of a very important sequence of events and you wait for the attorney to ask what's next, and I think that makes it sound a bit rehearsed. I would prefer for it to be more genuine.	- The biggest problem for this witness is that he enjoyed the free meals and gifts from Poole and I don't know if there's a good way to get around it, but if it was me I would say "Cameron took care of me when he knew that I needed money, that's why I wanted to take care of him to stop him from going down the wrong path... But alas I've been a bad friend..." etc. Something like this. \r\n- In terms of confusing the button and the lever, I think I would've handled it by emphasizing that I was stressed, I panicked, I regret this every day, etc, but I don't know why my hand just moved to the wrong thing in the blink of a second, blahblah.	- I like that you say things like "this is very important to the jury today" to let us know that we should pay attention.	- You are aggressive and polite at the same time. I love that combination.	9	- I like that you tried to incorporate what happened during the trial in the beginning of the closing. It would be great if you could incorporate more! I also found it effective that you invoked the presence of the victim. \r\n- You are very good at public speaking. Your delivery is spot on. The content was very clearly presented as well.	10	- You are a great public speaker. The way you present information is crystal clear. \r\n- I like that you incorporated a lot of your wins in the cross examinations into your closing.	61	163	21	76	78	23	26	24	80	83	t
146	6	- Fair structure, but the story and elements of the crime are a bit vague\r\n- Don't read from your script\r\n- "He must pay for what he did" >> stronger theme?	7	- Don't read from your screen\r\n- Adjust your camera angle and use some gestures to help your storytelling\r\n- Note your tone and pace\r\n- Try to point out the "reasonable doubts" from your side	7	6	7	6	- I like your glasses, but plzzz look at the camera and stop reading\r\n- You don't sound surprised when you said 'to my surprise' lol\r\n- No need to repeat your whole answer when the opposing counsel raised an objection	- Don't say too much 'If you are referring to..' It makes you sound offensive and less credible\r\n- Be more familiar with your affidavit	- Don't talk directly to the opposing counsel when an objection is raised\r\n- Be more natural. More interaction with your witness. \r\n- Design your questions more coherently.	- When you are raising an objection, try to catch the keywords in the first place. Keep your objection short and precise. \r\n- Don't say 'Thank you, your honor'\r\n- Control your witness. You could ask the witness to clarify the answer if he did not answer it directly. (You did better in the following questions)\r\n- Be more familiar with the witness' testimony so that you won't feel panic when the witness does not understand your question. Just be prepared for everything that might happen in court.\r\n- "I will take it as a Yes...." >> it's improper (and the witness actually answered your question clear enough)	8	6	9	6	- Good character, but still, drop your notes\r\n- Your gesture is a bit too much\r\n- Too much 'that's the point'	- Some questions are kind of common sense, you don't need to be too aggressive\r\n- When you ask which part of revenue... you actually implied that you know the answers to the question. You can just kindly point out that some part of the revenue blahblahblah.	- Good structure of the questions. \r\n- Don't say 'I don't think.../probably...' when arguing an objection\r\n- Good use of screen sharing \r\n- You can raise objections during cross exam to protect your witness (esp when she said I'll take it as...)	- Good to paraphrase and break down the questions when the witness did not give you the expected answer.\r\n- Still need to be more responsive and control your witness\r\n- The witness just asked you to rephrase/clarify your question. It's not about impeachment.\r\n- You can't approach your opposing counsel during a Zoom trial hhh\r\n- DON'T TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE WITNESS	7	8	7	5	- Looks professional, but your tone is toooo scripted.\r\n- You can try to write down the calculation process etc to illustrate your conclusion better regarding the revenue (or any other conclusions regarding a large number of figures)	- Good to stay professional during the cross\r\n- Good explanation about the revenues	- Point out the exact number of rule that you are referring to\r\n- Since the Revenue records are not on the same page, it's difficult for us to see the change directly. \r\n- Try to use a document without highlights when screen sharing (and I don't really get your points by showing the report)	- Don't say "I believe"\r\n- Improper conclusion given by the witness?\r\n- Try to answer precisely to the objections\r\n- Control your witness (otherwise it would be difficult to follow your logic/flow of questions and understand how they are related to your case)\r\n- Rephrase your question and make sure that you can explain them clearly	8	6	9	7	- Good character\r\n- Good tone and gesture (but your smile is kind of weird..	- You totally lost your character during the cross exam	- I like your expressions, very natural\r\n- Good 'eye contact'\r\n- Why you seem like reading from the script when arguing for objections (?)	- Your internet connection is poor\r\n- Points are clear	9	8	7	9	- Good, easy to follow\r\n- I like the expressions you show when you try to recall something (e.g., the detective's name)	- Good to stay neutral	- Be more natural\r\n- Why do you look happy during the direct(?\r\n- Guide your witness through the questions, not reading them out line by line.	- Good and precise questions\r\n- Good emphasis on specific words\r\n- But still, avoid testifying\r\n- Clear illustration of the exhibits	7	7	6	9	- Good costume\r\n- Your gesture has nothing to do with your testimony\r\n- Fair, but you can have more character (and don't read!!	- Fair	- You need to understand the grounds of objection thoroughly, otherwise your argument would not be convincing and effective	- The threshold of 'more prejudicial than probative' is rather high I'd say. The factors that can be taken into account in prejudicial evidence are normally moral problems or a substantial waste of time without sufficient probative value. There needs to be a significant risk of misuse of the evidence by the jury, or extremely confusing for such evidence to be excluded. \r\n- Good follow-up questions\r\n- Good to sort the questions into different parts (which makes your point clear	8	- Overall good, but your closing should reflect and relate to more points that you get during the trial\r\n- You can use some questions to guide the jury through each element\r\n- Good rebuttal	5	- The law will not prove..\r\n- You are not even familiar with the charges, that's not good\r\n- Don't read out so many questions (6) at one time. Try to briefly summarize the keywords.\r\n- I'm kind of lost in the second half of your closing. What are the reasonable doubts (other possibilities) raised by your side?\r\n- Good to quote the answers from P's witnesses	42	171	126	122	29	32	27	121	123	30	t
151	6	- also during your pre-trial matters, invoke rule 615\r\n- you have to start slow, xxx, she pulled? i personally totally missed that part so you really wanna be slow and firm about the most important sentences\r\n- "today we are here, xxxx" should be before you talk about counts and case laws - keep in mind that jurors know nth about the case and have no legal background	7	- the starting sentence is too long to be strong, you should try to make the theme clearer\r\n- you should refrain from directly reading from the script and try to do it without a script and make more eye contact\r\n- "just trying to do the right thing at the right time" should be your theme instead\r\n- nice structure overall	7	7	7	7	- fluent answers, nice costume	- how can you not know if you were sentimental, just let it go cuz its just not important, esp when you have a crossing attorney whos deadly serious about every single word you said\r\n- overall good performance throughout	- what you explained about exhibit 3 doesn't suffice as a hearsay exception, you just talked about laying foundations\r\n- when the crosser says "in your affidavit", that is the causing for hearsay\r\n- also the impeachment didn't really prove the inconsistency so if there is good wifi condition you are free to object to "improper impeachment" - this could be a risky one sometimes and some judges dislike it but if you get it sustained, it would be really embarrassing for the crossing attorney	- very nice objection and case law prep but you need to work on your delivery - tone, facial expression, communication, and engagement with the judge and jurors - you want to be persuasive as an attorney who cares about her client, not who is forced to work on the case and represents the client that she thinks is guilty\r\n- also questions are too long, need to cut them short \r\n- don't take a blurry answer with "okay fine", if it's fine no matter what she says why bother asking the question?\r\n- don't say "in your affidavit" bc that's hearsay\r\n- impeachments are not always so effect esp when you can't find the page and line, it's just a waste of your time; also i think you should confirm the authenticity of the copy before you let the witness read out the line	7	6	7	6	- Chinese immigrant mom raising 3 kids\r\n- try to not laugh when you are in character? or did I misunderstand\r\n- overall good character and answers	- felt like you became silent in the cross, just handle it the same way as your direct, maintain your character	- if you think the opposing counsel is testifying, don't object to "speculation"\r\n- you do have ideas, but you should bring up the ground of your objection first before you say a bunch of sentences for the sake of clarity - also the judge was giving a tip as calls for speculation but you objected to "counsel testifying" & "hearsay"	- you should think through your objection and stand by it\r\n- too many questions, kinda lose focus of your cross \r\n- avoid sketchy questions because you can always leave them at your closing addressing all the possibilities	7	6	5	7	- you had your sunglasses and seemed chill at the beginning but you kinda lost your character after the mic issues	- there's more to say besides 'yes', try to add in stuff explaining your relationship with Kimball	- if you skip a question, how do you lay foundations?\r\n- what do you mean by "do you know what the problem is?", keep in mind that we the jurors don't have any prior knowledge about the case so you need to be crystal clear when laying foundations and avoid asking leading questions\r\n- also it doesn't matter what you think, whether Poole and Bowman are complicit, as you mentioned in your response to the hearsay objection, find out hearsay exceptions\r\n- you need to work on your direct because it assumes a lot of facts and contains a lot of leading questions	- instead of 'counsel testifying', do you mean 'lack of foundation' & 'leading questions\r\n- you have good ideas of objection but just need to work on familiarizing yourself with the grounds like hearsay when the opposing counsel is talking about an exhibit not admitted yet into evidence\r\n- with a 3min limit, you should try to only ask about the focus instead of following the prompt	7	6	6	7	- nice answers but i wish you had more character and speak louder and more firmly	- feel like you should add more character to your answer when testifying	- okay it's nice to see the three types of wristbands but is it necessary - unless you think it will be useful in your team's closing\r\n-  about the text message, check out hearsay exception 804b3\r\n- you probably can tell that you are letting a lot of objections in based on the way you organized your direct so work on your questions and answers\r\n- why are you not objecting to exhibit 3 as evidence? you have to pay attention and you can still argue it was an improper impeachment	- not all statements that include the word "asking" is hearsay and you should avoid saying that you are raising this objection only bc you heard the word "asking"\r\n- a good job in the later part with all the objections but be careful with the frequency because some judges tend not to like it when you are objecting too much so only object when necessary\r\n- so bowman is familiar with all the things she told the police but why would you expect she is familiar with the report that the police have pulled together, the impeachment is just not helpful\r\n- stop screen sharing after you have showcased the exhibit	6	6	7	7	- should have more character, not memorable so far	- why did you sneak into LS's office? say more besides simple yes or no\r\n- 'you are not good at math, right?' - 'no, I'm not'; instead of 'yeah'\r\n- cover for others' rides? make up sth fun to explain instead of saying nothing	- try to argue with objections instead of letting your witness rephrase right away\r\n- try not to ask argumentative questions\r\n- don't talk directly with opposing counsel but to the judge	- good job raising objections but be clear and sure about it\r\n- also, why are you smiling all the time? why so happy? be wary of the way you behave in court too	8	7	6	8	- funny & professional accountant & bookkeeper\r\n- very nice emotions about Poole threatening you	- technically you are not only supposed to answer leading questions with yeses and no-es\r\n- you can't just help yourself and check with the attorney, its sth your attorney should do	- you need to work on objections and hearsay exceptions so you don't need to explain a bunch\r\n- "so what happened after three years", after the objection was ruled, give us a refresher "so you mentioned xxxx, what happened after 3 yrs..."	- decent cross with good objections and questions	8	- she planned so she pushed? gamble and casino? should elaborate more, how is this a gamble, who gambled, whos the she? bowman? why she gambled, it's not crystal clear\r\n- better explanation later with body language\r\n- nice asking and answering about the planning and pushing	8	- the theme of landing a hand should be incorporated into bowman's direct cuz i couldn't tell her intention while she was testifying on the stand\r\n- also if she cant speak or makes a minimal wage, it should be further shown in her character	36	100	184	68	185	74	71	186	73	189	t
244	8	Good storytelling at the beginning of the opening. "The darkness became a shield" is a nice way of putting it. I also like that you didn't introduce the names too early, made it easier to follow. Only two points that I think you could work on: You can definitely pause more during transitions and don't overuse hand movements. You moved your hands along with your entire opening, which lessened the impact of when you used those movements for emphasis.\r\n\r\nOh and also, when you say MOTJ, you say it reaaally quick. The rest of your speaking speed is pretty solid, for some reason you speed up when you say that.	7	The rhetoric at the beginning was a bit stunted, maybe it was too much repetition for my taste. For me, when you just list facts, it's harder for me to remember than a story. I did like the three questions though, good framing for this trial. Same comment as P opener regarding too much hand movement.	8	7	7	7	Wait, this map is a demo? Did y'all... make this? That's impressive, but I'm also surprised defense didn't have something to say ab this. You're likable as Longstreet, although I didn't get a strong sense of character from you. I think you kept it very conversational with your attorney though, which is good. Didn't score for this obviously, but you lagged at times for me, and I may have missed some answers.	Short cross, not a lot for you to do here. I would just say that you had a bit more character and energy on direct.	It was just a little awkward when the witness offered to buy you a milkshake and you disregarded it. I think it's fine to say a "That's alright Ms. Longstreet" before continuing with your questions. Good job letting the witness shine. Good hearsay response. Could pause a little before ending direct.	First hearsay objection wasn't correct, but it was good to break up their flow. Very respectful on cross examination. But you can vary your tone a lot more. A lot of questions started with "and" and ended with "right" and they sorted melded together. Pretty short cross	7	7	9	8	You immediately give off very assertive vibes. You sound like you know what you're talking about. Oop, when you move your arm forward to your laptop, I immediately assume you're scrolling to read. If you're not doing that, I would avoid that motion. If you are doing that... change your camera setup so judges don't notice. (Although IDK if you'll be competing on zoom again)\r\n\r\nGood explanation of what your investigation is, and what you relied on. I like the way you gesture to your wrist when you talked about the bracelets. You did speed up a little bit as your direct went on.	You maintained your credibility well on this cross. The bias didn't land super hard, you still seem like a good investigator.	You match the witness's energy well. I like your transitions and signposts. The structure of this direct is very clear. Hmmm, the demo is very nice. But the trend between the two different ticket types isn't so different that it seems super damning. The bracelet loophole seems more important. You can pause a bit after the witness gives an important answer to let it sink in. Great response to hearsay objections. Great job that when an objection was sustained, you did exactly what the judge requested you to do.	Good knowledge of RoE, however you didn't sound super sure of yourself during the first argument. Showed that you were paying close attention to your direct.\r\n\r\nGood initial signpost. The points you made on this cross match what you say you would show in opening, which is nice. However, I wonder how much being biased towards Longstreet means that they're biased against the defendant. If a victim of a crime is my friend, I would try harder to find the truth, no?\r\n\r\nGood witness control, and you were in control of this cross. I like that you got more energetic on your strongest points.	8	8	8	7	I like the background.  The traffic cop thing confused me a little, but I might just be slow. It was a little odd for you to ask the attorney if they wanted to see the control panel. Good job dragging out the story of not letting Bowman taking over the ride, but that she insisted and lied to operate it anyway.  Overall pretty entertaining.	Great job maintaining character and remaining likable on cross. You seemed like the same person as on direct. "In Rachterworld, we do legal things" LOL I think you do a good job not being super biased as a witness. Fun to listen to.	You got to the point pretty quickly, and gave the witness the opportunity to explain their main points. Also, it sounded like you were asking real questions, AKA you sounded curious of what the answers were, which is nice. Good objection response. I like the way you emphasis different words within a question, it's a good way of showing what you care the most about.\r\n\r\nMmm, I don't think this redirect is super necessary. You can argue this point on closing, but it doesn't need to be this explicit.	I struggle to understand this character evidence objection. It's good to break up their flow because this is pretty bad evidence for defense, but I would probably find a different place.\r\n\r\nGood job laying foundation for 11A, but make sure you remember which exhibits have already been admitted. Oh interesting, I like this point of contrasting the two control panels. It was hard for me to believe someone could mess up using a 3 button panel, but this was convincing.	10	7	7	9	Likable, credible from the beginning. And you sound sad, which is good. (That sounds mean) You do a convincing job of playing a person who is oblivious to the robbery. It's hard to believe you would be involved in this scheme. When you describe the crime, you do sound disappointed and scared, which was nice. Good tonal variation throughout this direct. Oh wow, you sound super remorseful. The details of liking the officer that was injured, nice touch.	Hmm, it would have been nice to have some explanation for this cross of why you went to that ride. But if these are facts you have to concede, you do it in a non-suspicious way. That's tough -- there are just a lot of bad facts. Dang, is there a way to get around any of these facts.	I like the way you get it out at the beginning and give a chance for the witness to say she wasn't involved in the crime. Like the last attorney, you also have a good way of asking questions where it sounds like you actually want to know the answer. I wish there was a better explanation of why Bowman took over the ride, but I'm guessing that's just not in the case packet.	I like the objection of speculation. You also sound very confident when you object. Leading question objection shows you do a good job of listening. I like the parallels between this cross and the direct of Billy.  Ooo, bringing in testimony from earlier is a cool move. And contrasting it with the witness's prior statement is nice.\r\n\r\nGood explanation of it not being character evidence. The limiting instruction is a little weird to me, just because I'm not sure what character trait can be extracted from operating the blackout before.	8	8	6	6	This witness seems really on edge. This makes sense since you were robbed, but I think building up to that emotion makes more sense, rather than starting at that level initially. Good job seeming very bothered by that night though.	Good job maintaining your character on cross. You seemed to be in the same emotional space as the direct. Good job getting really scared again once she started crossing you on the robbery.	Sometimes your speech was very overly stiff. I know you're trying to be professional, but it's good to be more conversational. Wait so on this wristband thing, I'm getting confused. Why do we keep going over Poole's scam? Both sides agree that it happened. Y'all just disagreement about Bowman's role in it, but there weren't really any questions about that. Also, you can pause a bit when the witness is getting very agitated.	Whoa, that's a p aggressive way to start a cross of a witness who was robbed at knifepoint. I would probably start this cross a little more agreeably, and then build to the aggression.  Wait if you're prosecution and you're saying this witness might be lying -- what exactly are they lying about? You agree that Poole was a thief, don't you? If you're crossing this witness about them getting robbed, you haaaaave to be more agreeable to the witness. Good job getting away with "it must have been Bowman's knife" <- I forget the wording of the rest of the question, but this is a substantial thing to get away with.	6	6	5	8	For some reason, this witness seems a little happy to be here, or like, they're in on a joke. I was a little confused of exactly what this witness proves -- very short direct as well.	Same demeanor as on direct, which is good. I think that you did the right thing not to fight too much with the attorney. You remained likable, and you didn't let him dictate the pace too much.\r\n\r\nHmm, you're actually fighting the "scandalous" pocket a lot. I don't think you need to. There's nothing that happened in your direct that really seems like you're making it up. Plus... you're on defense. The prosecution's theory is much more scandalous than the defense's. Maybe that's actually the way to go about this. Yeah, it would actually be GOOD for you if the defendant was found guilty, yet you're testifying for the defense anyway. IDK, maybe there's a reason you can't get away with that.	Good job letting the witness shine, I like your tone for the most part. Could use a bit more variation, but that's true for everyone else. I hear a little feedback at times, not scoring for that, but may have missed 1 or 2 questions. I agree with you on the 403 objection. When you're right, just believe in your argument! You got there though, so good job.\r\n\r\nCharacter evidence objection likely wasn't needed. I think it's definitively a credibility issue.	Good confidence on objection. Pivoting to sort of a relevance from 403 was maybe not the move, although it was responsive to what opposing counsel said. Good job handling the witness when you had to repeat a question. Also, your response to the character evidence objection was solid. Nothing seems to shake you. My thing is, a bias pocket doesn't land that hard when the witness doesn't get much out on direct that could be a lie or made up. Like, I don't understand what you're accusing Ms. Hunter of doing as a result of her bias.\r\n\r\nWaiiiit, "I recommend that you save your explanation for redirect" is just weird to me. Feel free to witness control more aggressively, but this is not how I would phrase it.	8	Technically very sound. Well structured, and you emphasis different points well. I think my biggest concern with this closing is that it seems, on some level, that you're almost strutting. In my view, the prosecution should strive to be very serious, and it felt like you were doing laps. Other than that, very well argued. I think the way you explained what it is you actually have to prove was extremely good. Complicity is a difficult concept to break down, and you did it well.\r\n\r\nOh wooooow, you explained what story you think the journalist is after. Good angle. I didn't pick up on it in your cross, but it made sense here. I will caution you that a lot of attorneys will put more emphasis on the witnesses that they crossed/directed, be careful not to do that.	9	Really strong argument. I think you're right that the prosecution never established a proper motive. If this is a robbery... And Bowman doesn't seem like a person who wanted cash or needed cash, why did she do this? Good job getting morally outraged at the prosecution. The way you changed your tone and sped up was very good.\r\n\r\nYou're right about the knife as well. There's plenty of doubt that the knife was actually Bowman's. I actually didn't hear about the prosecution talk about it that much though. Really solid job overall.\r\n\r\nMy only thing is that I wish the way that you framed the argument in	69	129	7	1	20	19	14	4	15	5	t
180	7	PRETRIAL:\r\n- typically don't do witness intros in pretrial, introducing the witnesses to the judge in real life doesn't change much\r\n- Great job challenging their understanding of party opponent!\r\n- Stay on screen during their pretrial. \r\n\r\nOPENING:\r\nThe concealment of coincidences should not become a curtain for a man's greed. - Theme is too long and takes too much inference to understand.\r\n\r\nI like your story pocket, a bit too dramatic and theatrical.\r\n\r\nTake a bit more time to introduce the people we're talking about, you are the first the jury (and the judge sometimes) have heard about the case. You jumped into the facts of the case pretty quick.\r\n\r\nTry a wider camera angle so you have more room to move around - movement makes your statement more dynamic and more interesting. It also helps you change your tone throughout. Right now, your tone is pretty stagnant throughout. \r\n\r\nNice use of hand gestures, but they're a little frequent, you want to either emphasize with your voice OR with your hands, not both at the same time. \r\n\r\nMake sure that you're directing your opening to the jury - in real life you're convincing a jury, not a judge.\r\n\r\nAlso,  you can't state any evidence as fact until it is on the record. You need to make sure that you're qualifying the vast majority of your statements will "you will hear..." "the evidence will show...." etc. \r\n\r\nNo law pocket - I don't know what you have to prove, or what your burden is without this.	8	I like the party opponent argument, but detective and police officer are technically two different positions in an office. FBI agents, Detectives, etc. are typically party opponents for the prosecution\r\n\r\nOPENING:\r\nIt's Cameron Poole, not Whit Bowman -> to the point, I know who you're blaming, and it's short, which I like. However, it's not something that would stick in my head. Give me a larger idea, this is a bit too literal for a theme.\r\n\r\nLOVED the law pocket. I think that the "lot of words" thing was funny, but it might be a bit too casual. \r\n\r\nOpposing counsel said nothing about the law - USE THAT. "What the prosecution didn't tell you in their opening statement.....was that they have a burden, the highest burden in the legal system, etc."\r\n\r\nI liked the use of demonstratives, and the three fact structure, made it easy to follow.\r\n\r\nI like the hand gestures, but commit to them more. Right now they're near the bottom of the frame, and they feel improvised, not intentional.\r\n\r\nAlso, USE THE SPACE! You stayed in the middle the entire statement - movement makes your statement more dynamic and more interesting. It also helps you change your tone throughout. Right now, your tone is pretty stagnant throughout. \r\n\r\nGreat appeals to the jury, and harping on the burden.	7	6	8	7	Nice job with the corporate background, fits the character. \r\n\r\nMake sure you're only answering the question you were asked - "What do you do for a living?" - response shouldn't include info about your husband. \r\n\r\nAlso, try and take pauses, breaths, and take time to think like a normal person would. Right now, your pace and wording sounds a bit like you're reading from a script. I would recommend writing bullet points instead of full answers and improvising when you answer.	You had solid explanations, I think you just fight too often. You are one of the more biased witnesses and are already at. a disadvantage. You need to seem like everything is just rolling off your back and you're completely fine with the questions you're being asked.	Maybe don't disclose that this witness and the detective are good friends - makes investigation sound biased\r\n\r\n"Relationship was pretty good" was stricken, don't loop it in your question. \r\n\r\nIf you want to use 803.6, be prepared to defend every prong of 803.6. The opposing side can pick any prong, and get your evidence thrown out based on that alone. It's a tricky rule.  In this case, I wouldn't use this for the truth, but the effect on the listener, being Whit Bowman/Poole, who knew these rules and believed them to be true.	HS - Make them proffer the subsequent action! Don't just take their word for it. Unless they can connect the statement directly to a later action, subsequent action doesn't apply. \r\n\r\nSpec - well timed, great job making them lay foundation. \r\n\r\nCharac Ev - requires a specific trait, and they have to be using it to show propensity for it to be inadmissible. "Wanting a raise" isn't necessarily a trait on its own. If they tried to say he was greedy or ungrateful, you could object to that. \r\n\r\nDon't withdraw, just say that you stand by your objection and let the judge rule. That argument got fairly messy. \r\n\r\nFOR CROSS:\r\nYour questions were good, but it felt like you weren't really getting in a rhythm. YOU are in control of everything that's happening. Try and speak slower, louder, and pause more. Never let it seem like you're caught off guard. Content is not your issue, and you control verbally pretty well, I just need to see confidence in your demeanor now.	8	7	7	7	Try and angle yourself in the center, and look into the camera, otherwise it looks like you're reading. \r\n\r\nI like the appeal to duty to find the truth, your answers are great. I need to hear your conviction in your tone of voice and see the emotion on your face. Right now, you're saying the right things, but I can't tell that you CARE about what you're testifying about.	Great job with the bias. \r\nDon't cave to the yes or no control. \r\nExplanations were good, they're too frequent. Give a few more simple answers. \r\nYou sped up on cross a decent amount. \r\n"Reasonably, yes." sounds a bit defensive.	SLOW DOWWNNNN! You have great questions + arguments, but you are speaking way too fast. \r\n\r\nThe back and forth between you and the witness also needs to slow down. In real life, people have to pause and think about questions and answers.\r\n\r\nGreat job making the distinction between tendering her as an expert and when she makes a conclusion. However, for 702c, you have to give me an actual method. Even if her method is just reading the reports and speaking to witnesses, she has to explicitly state that on direct in order to satisfy 702c. \r\n\r\nSlow down A TON during objection arguments, keeping your calm will make you sound more professional and confident. \r\n\r\nDON'T END YOUR DIRECT ON AN OBJECTION! Ask another question. \r\n\r\n703 allows you to testify to otherwise inadmissible facts and data, not skip testifying about foundation and say conclusions on their own. If you wanted, you could've used 705 to do that. \r\n\r\nDO NOT raise 403 to bias, you're making the defense's argument for them, and you should let your witness handle it!\r\n\r\nHS is a quote. Just because something is based on an exhibit, unless you can point me to a specific statement from a document or person that's being elicited, it's admissible. \r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think you needed the redirect, she handled the bias well on her own.	Specify what prong of 702c you're objecting under.\r\n\r\nBe LOUD and confident! You had good objection arguments, but you seemed unsure of yourself. \r\n\r\nYour second objection wasn't improper expert opinion it was lack of foundation. \r\n\r\nGood LOF. I liked that you raised them, it flags it for the judge before cross even happens. Make sure you open your cross with why these conclusions can't be trusted.\r\n\r\nOBJECT HS TO THE TEXTS! The white ones are allegedly from poole, but there's not enough foundation to establish that by a preponderance so 804 cannot be applied. \r\n\r\nThe yes/no control was premature, she hadn't fought you that hard, I don't think you had earned that level of control yet.\r\n\r\nObjection arguments are not in first person - try not to use "I did..." "I think..." Instead, it's "the defense's contention," "We believe, etc." \r\n\r\nif she says she doesn't remember Jackie Hunter, but her affidavit says something else - IMPEACH! I'm not entirely sure if the affidavit says something specific about their relationship, but it seemed like you wanted to impeach.	7	7	6	9	The bar background is fun!\r\n\r\nTry and vary your pitch, speed, and tone more! Think about how you would tell this story if you were just talking to one of your friends to make it sound more natural. Right now, it feels very scripted.\r\n\r\nBreak up the first answer. It did tread into narrative.\r\n"What do you do for a living?"\r\n- I'm a bartender at Chuggies.\r\n"How'd you get into that profession?"\r\n- I used to work at Racheter World, this amusement park, but I got fired.\r\n\r\nYou are technically constructively not present during objection arguments, so try not to laugh during them or respond to them.	I thought you held up really well on cross, great job!	HS - For the Longstreet statement, don't offer it for the truth, do its effect. You don't care if it's true, just that Bowman (the person that heard it) believed it was true and said it to Isaacs.\r\n\r\nDON'T END YOUR DIRECT ON AN OBJECTION! Ask another question.	Even if they do a narrative, objecting comes across as pretty aggressive for a character witness. Just be mindful of how you're being perceived. \r\n\r\nVery solid HS objections. And really well articulated arguments. Don't smile after you win objection arguments, keep your composure.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for paying attention to the record instruction I gave at the beginning. \r\n\r\nGreat job following procedure, you have a solid tone as well. Just SLOW DOWN and project more confidence. You are in control of this cross, act like it. \r\n\r\nGood job pointing out discrepancies within his answers!	7	7	7	7	Great demeanor when talking about Cameron! \r\n\r\nAnswers are pretty conversational, great job! \r\n\r\nTears are a bit much, it feels over the top. Think about how someone would act in real court.	I like the idea of using your emotions on cross, but again, it's over the top and feels inauthentic when your emotions fluctuate a lot in a short period of time.	I like front-loading the accusations, worked well to have her directly respond to them. \r\n\r\nLove the "can you explain to the jury"\r\n\r\nMake sure you know your witness' timeline in and out. He pointed out a discrepancy and made you look unprepared.	Leading questions presuppose an answer, or they have the answer already in the question. For example, "You spoke to all of the witnesses in this case, right?" would be a leading question. "Did you speak to all of the witnesses?" is NOT leading because it does not presume that the witness did or did not speak to anyone.\r\n\r\nThank you for screensharing to clear up the discrepancy. \r\n\r\nDo not laugh during their direct. \r\n\r\nIntro to cross was very aggressive.	9	9	9	6	Cigarette might be a step too far? Talk to your coaches about it.\r\n\r\nGreat tone of voice, pausing, conversationally - you're very authentic as a witness, well done!	Great job handling the bias, you did really well on cross. It didn't seem like anything affected you at all. Genuinely, one of the best witnesses I've seen this weekend. Well done!\r\n\r\nBe mindful of what you're doing during objection arguments, don't shake your head or react. It can be seen as disrespectful. Also, you are technically not supposed to be present during objection arguments as a witness, so you should not be reacting to them in real time.	Nice job using movement and hand gestures.\r\n\r\nGood relevance argument, but relevance is SUCH a low bar. If it's even tangentially related to the case, it's in. Not a good objection to make in general. Also, if they're making an irrelevant point, LET THEM! It's wasting their time and it doesn't harm your case inherently. \r\n\r\nAlso, his bias is incredibly relevant! Every witnesses' bias is imperative for the jury to hear, not something to object to, let your witness handle it.	Try and clear up the structure of your cross, it felt very scattered and disorganized. I wasn't sure what points you were trying to make throughout. \r\n\r\nSlow down during objection arguments, it will give you time to think and avoid pauses and stuttering.	8	7	8	7	QR code was very cute, I liked it. \r\n\r\nYou fit this character well and you seem excited. \r\n\r\nTry and vary up your pitch and tone more to sound more natural. Right now, your pitch goes up at the end of every sentence, which makes you sound a bit scripted.	Don't elaborate a lot immediately. Start with simple yeses/nos, only fight if it's vital to your character or your case.		Good job handling the character bit at the beginning\r\n\r\nYes/no control at the start was solid, I think it's just a bit too long.\r\n\r\nGreat speed and pacing, you have a solid command of your speech.	8		8		56	122	57	236	113	114	58	56	112	60	t

I wasn't sure if that was written in or not. which is good, it was believable and the jokes were solid.	- Didn't really fight on cross.\r\n- Kept consistent character overall	- Well written direct. \r\n- The final point was smart, but flipable\r\n- Your questions did a good job of leaning into the witnesses character	- Good closed ended questions\r\n- effective point on control panel	7	7	7	8	- Seemed Believable \r\n- Good response to question about purposely pressing the button.	- The first response didn't make sense, why did you call poole your partner?\r\n- Good response to why you lied\r\n- You agreed to a lot in the beginning and saved the fight for the stronger points	- Good rhythm between you and the witness \r\n- The demo was effective\r\n- Good timeline of the day\r\n- You treated the defendant as an eyewitness, which seemed to work\r\n- The hearsay objection was good, you could have argued against all of poole's statements, you conceded that they were coconspirators	- Good job establishing she has lied to the police and good job establishing motive\r\n- You got the texts in, but didn't do much with them in cross,	7	- I liked the line about whit always around during poole's crime\r\n- If you are going to screenshare, make sure it is timely.

295	7	Might want to do something to explain WHY the case law is important--I'm not sure why it was worth drawing attention to.\r\n"He turned off the light to hide all his lies" - THEME\r\nGood speed and variation in tone.\r\nCould use a bit more context at the beginning of the story--starting in media res is powerful, but can lead to confusion.\r\nGood to go through the elements of the crime.\r\nObviously you're in a pretty confined space, but consider incorporating a BIT of movement--to indicate transitions, etc.\r\nNeed more of a general story placing basic characters and setting in context--you're name-dropping people in these witness sections and I don't know who they are or why they're important.\r\nExceeded time by at least a full minute--need to pay attention to that.	7	"The real defendant isn't here" - THEME\r\nIf your theory is that the defendant committed a mistake, theme doesn't really capture that.\r\nBeyond a reasonable doubt DOES NOT EQUAL 100 percent certainty. That language will get you a mistrial in real life.\r\nGood to frame case in terms of questions to be answered.\r\nUnclear to me what exactly the journalist will be adding to your case.\r\nWhat is t	8	8	8	7	Good enthusiasm and speed.\r\nNeed to break this map testimony down way more--putting all of the locations in a single answer is just confusing.\r\nDate line is odd.\r\nWeird to remain super-cheerful and chipper when talking about park losing money and Bowman's bad attitude. Need to modulate tone appropriately.\r\nWhen using names, whenever possible, provide context for judges unfamiliar with case. Not just "Haley Floyd," but "Haley Floyd, the ticket booth operator."\r\nMilkshake thing doesn't land as a character trait for me.	I like the "numbers are small" answer--realistic.\r\nGood responses on Exhibit 7.\r\nGenerally good.\r\nDon't refer to yourself in the third person.	What exactly is Rachterworld? Need to establish that before going through a map of it.\r\nNeed to break some of this testimony up--it's hard to follow.\r\nGood conversational tone.\r\nDon't rest hand over stomach all of the time.\r\nAs an attorney, you are allowed to draw the attention to things, and that often makes the direct sound more natural. Rather than having the witness unnaturally segue to blackout mode, just ask something like "I'd like to talk about the Tunnel of Terror ride specifically. How does it work? [Answer.} What is "blackout mode"? [Answer.]\r\nGenerally well-organized.\r\nJust say "no objection to screen sharing."\r\nWeak hearsay objection on "Bowman has to pay"	Kind of jumped the gun when doing pre-trial and launched into entire laundry list of things rather than responding to judge's question--listen to what the judge is asking you.\r\nNeed to object to "guy's gonna kill me scream"\r\n"Full of spreadsheets" is weird phrasing.\r\nWhat was the point of Exhibit 7? No idea why you were asking about it. If it's just to enter it so that someone can talk about it later, need to make that clear, and to ask fewer questions about it.\r\nNeed some signposting to make the point of these cross pockets clear.\r\nDon't raise pitch at end of questions on cross--lower it.\r\nThis cross is starting to drag.\r\nPicked up at the end--could have gotten rid of some of the fluff toward the beginning.	9	7	8	9	Interesting take on character--very intense.\r\nCan slow down just a tad.\r\nDon't need to be quite so aggressive with "the FCU just doesn't make mistakes." Makes you sound a bit arrogant.	Avoid informal answers like "Yeah," "sure," "for sure," etc. Not very cop-like or consistent with character as presented.\r\nComing across as a little overly defensive and flustered--need to keep your cool.	Don't refer to detective as "Ms. Kimball." Needs to be "Detective Kimball" or something similar.\r\nGood use of arrows on the graphs--easy to follow.\r\nVery well-organized direct examination. Tone is a little flat.\r\nOverstated FRE 703--it's not an exception to hearsay.\r\n"What is your take on this case?" is a hopelessly vague question.	Good hearsay objection to journalist's statements, and good argument re: 703.\r\nDon't say "I believe" during hearsay objections. State your position as fact.\r\nNeed to object to vague-ass question "what is your take on this case?"\r\nWhat was the point of first pocket of cross? That they like their job?\r\nGood line of cross on arrest report.\r\nVery good cross examination--again, not sure why you started on your weakest point.	7	7	7	9	Okay, this is a bit much right out of the gate.\r\nHaving a character is important, but having a LIKEABLE character is more important.\r\nAnswers are not particularly natural, particularly with respect to blackout mode stuff, playing with fire, etc.	Don't concede that Cameron Poole was in the bar.\r\nWhat? Trying to be way too cute with this "I don't know how BOWMAN would stop the Mind Eraser" stuff. There's a button to stop it, it's not open to interpretation.	Tone is a bit flat, especially for extremely loud witness.\r\nSignpost to make clear why you're asking about what you are.\r\nSo what's the prosecution's theory of this ride? Why is important that Bowman was running the tunnel of terror?\r\nWhy are you objecting to Floyd's statement? Isn't it good for your side?\r\nNeed to renew your objection to the Mind Eraser stuff.	Not everything that's technically objectionable merits an objection. Do you really care whether the jury considers whether Longstreet has a new boyfriend/girlfriend?\r\nDon't ask the witness if she's like to answer your question.\r\nDon't roll eyes/get sarcastic when arguing objections.\r\nIf you get an objection to relevance, don't just respond that it's a low bar, explain WHY the question is relevant. There was a good reason why the Mind Eraser stuff was relevant but you didn't offer it to the judge for some reason, just stuck with the stock "low bar" argument.\r\nSpeculation is more than just "state of mind," need to unlearn that.\r\nOkay, we get it with the position of the buttons thing--you're kind of beating a dead horse here.\r\nGood control and content, but this cross is too long.	6	6	6	8	Shouldn't be wearing a T-shirt in a mock trial round\r\nWait, are you saying you're actually a Kennedy?\r\nOof, joke about Kennedys dying young is not in good taste.\r\nTone is not professional at all--want to come across as credible to the jury.\r\nSome really long run-on answers.	Is this Kennedy stuff supposed to be endearing? You don't just want to have a character, but a LIKEABLE character.	Tone is a little serious at the start--can be friendly with witness.\r\nMaybe ask a question at the beginning to kind of lay out why the witness is here.\r\nWhy should I care about the company's books?\r\nYou've gotta do some work to make clear to me why any of this stuff matters.	Throw in some relevance objections.\r\nGood speed, variation in tone.\r\nWhy should I care whether some editor published her stories...oh, I see now. Need to get to the point quicker.	7	8	8	8	Points for character, but tone it down a bit.\r\nBruh, did you intentionally show up late for an appearance as part of your character?\r\nThe energy is useful to emphasize the important parts of your character, but it loses its effect when you're super-energetic all the time. Also just not realistic.\r\nOkay, "heaven for functioning alcoholics" line was pretty funny.	Good, responsive.	Ask some questions at the beginning to explain why he's here, what he's gonna say that's important.\r\nWeak 803(2) objection argument.	Good, not a lot of comments.	8	7	7	7	I get that costuming is encouraged, but you still can't wear a T-shirt to court.\r\nGood speed, energy, very likeable.\r\nComing across as a bit defensive when talking about day of crime.\r\nSo you probably want to show some remorse about the fact that, by your own admission, you stood by and did nothing while your friend committed multiple felonies and ripped off your employer.	Don't sound annoyed with cross-examination. You need to keep the same energy you showed on cross, even though it's difficult.\r\nHoo boy, those are some damning text messages.\r\nHedging on "set up the job" thing didn't really work for me. And why are you fighting so hard on this? You admitted on direct that you had full knowledge of Cameron's ticket scheme.\r\nNeed to show remorse about tacit participation in scheme, not annoyance that attorney is asking you about it.	Tone is not very conversational--sound like you're reading off a sheet.\r\nDon't say "I believe" in objection arguments.	Good control of witness.\r\nI assumed you were building to an impeachment with the whole "set up the plan" thing--this is way more tenuous than that.\r\nGood god, you need to either impeach this dude or move on.\r\nOkay, if he wants to hedge on what "the job" is, read the preceding three or four sentences for context.\r\nImpeachment should have been done a lot quicker and cleaner than that. Totally derailed what was a pretty solid cross.	7	Tell me your story of how exactly this crime went down and what the defendant's role in it was. Your side has been throwing facts at me all trial without giving me the framework in which I'm supposed to slot them.\r\nAlso, that text message is DAMNING. You should do at least a full minute about it. (ed. Aaaaand you never used it at all.)\r\nWhy are you focusing so much on the knife when it's hands-down the weakest element of your case? He was basically the getaway driver, that makes him complicit in the crime.\r\nOkay, a bit more energy please.\r\nSpend your precious rebuttal time actually rebutting something, not just restating a point from your closing.	8	Okay, criminal defendant doesn't get brownie points for showing up to his own trial. Given lack of remorse shown by defendant for knowledge of felonious scheme, trying to make me feel sorry for him is not necessarily your best strategy.\r\nWHO IS THE REAL DEFENDANT WHO ISN'T HERE? Is it Poole? Or is it Longstreet?\r\nI need a coherent explanation of what exactly y'all think happened in this case. Right now it's just a bunch of spaghetti thrown at the wall. It's closing, explain to me exactly what YOU think happened in this case.	77	165	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t
137	8	Pre-trial: Hi guys, don't worry. Technical issues happen all the time, but make sure you don't leave the judge confused in the beginning. \r\n\r\nConceal, connect, complicit.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a very solid script! I think you should focus on delivery. It seems to me that you're reading from your notes, which makes your hand gestures a little awkward. This also has to do with the positioning of your camera. Often times I can't see what you're gesturing from this angle. If you stood further back, you can proceed to use the space in front of you to your advantage. \r\n\r\nGood circling back to your theme throughout your speech.	6	Pre-trial: This is a perfect chance to show how confident you guys are! Smile, be loud, be clear, be confident. You don't get another chance for a first impression.\r\n\r\nThink of an actual opening statement in court, or maybe you're giving a coporate presentation, or a class PPT. It has to be online, would it be better if we saw you move, instead of just your head?\r\n\r\nYou must pay attention, that openings are opening STATEMENTS, not OPENING ARGUMENTS. It's your job for openings to introduce the witnesses, tell the jury what this case is about, and why it matters. It's more of a PREVIEW of the things to come. \r\n\r\nConsider spending more time discussing reasonable doubt. Talking about how hard it is for P to meet their burden. And hint, that it's your case theory that this  was an "inside job"	9	7	9	7	LOL, the background is perfect. And I say perfect because it really fits the background, a cheap boss. You're exerting a very confident vibe, fit for a boss. \r\n\r\nI really think if you add a good joke or two in your direct that would elevate everything. The reason is, you're slow, clear, and confident. However, as the direct goes longer, 会比较平. Alternatively, maybe you can be merrier? It's also helpful to lean forwards to highlight the important parts of your testimony, or even take a short pause.\r\n\r\nThere's something called the primacy-recency effect, which pretty much means your first answers and last answers should be really memorable. "He's not supposed to be ANYWHERE NEAR the ToT"	"yeah, look at my trailer office, we struggle sometimes" \r\n\r\nYou sound less confident on cross. Even perhaps a little timid, not sure why. Not a major change in character. I think the general problem is, I don't sense any emotions, or the right amount of emotions I would expect.\r\n\r\nOh I hated that re-direct. It didn't make any sense to me. Why would you volunteer information that you've been investigated for tax fruad? D didn't, and very likely couldn't get that information via cross.	Excellent signposting!!! Instead of "the Prosecution wants to" just "P moves", or "P tenders" \r\n\r\nSo I think it's also important to have the first witness of the case talk about what all this means. The names don't mean anything to a judge. If I haven't read the case (and many judges are like that), they have no idea who Cameron Poole is.\r\n\r\nAs your witness points out how they are different, it would be nice to have highlights shown on the PPT. Looks more professional.	Ohh that's an interesting hearsay objection for the control panel. Maybe have them argue that this is "constructively entered", or a limiting instructions. You don't necessarily have to give them that leeway. But honestly, it's just not hearsay since we don't care about those scratches right? \r\n\r\nMost judges are going to score you down if they sense you are reading from notes. I might be wrong here, (speculation!).  The first segment of your cross was a bit confusing to me, It wasn't clear to me why it mattered that she's a cheapstake. \r\n\r\n"I'd like to start by talking about how you run your park" stuff like that. \r\nSame advice as above, highlight the demo! Use technology! \r\n\r\nTo improve your cross, I think your next step is to add clear signposting so the judge won't be wondering why you're asking these questions.	8	8	8	7	Great intro, notice how Judge Lesicko laughed? I suggest having even a bigger personality. Wave hands a bit more! Shrug. Maybe you don't care that much. More street lingo? \r\n\r\n"I pick up customers from point A, I take them to point B. If I'm lucky they're quiet, if I'm not I clean up afterwards. yeah that's pretty much my job, boring huh?" \r\n\r\nYou're smiling all the time. I like that. But when you got to the conversation about Poole and ? I'm not sure why you were smiling or maybe smirking at that time.	Some of the answers were too lengthy. "Your client was Cameroon Poole, right?"\r\n\r\nWhen Ms. Guo asked about Cameron Poole having a few friends. That's a perfect opportunity to go like yeah yeah yeah, but I don't know exactly who else was involved.	Again, great signposting! \r\n\r\nI suggest matching your tone to your witness. This seems like a gal who's extroverted and merry. The chemistry between you two, I'd say it's a little off. You sound just a little bit robotic.  \r\n\r\nSo, the case law you cited, actually doesn't work that way. Co-conspirator is a condition. We're actually here to determine whether or not they are co-conspirators. Ok you're familiar with State v Owens as well. Structure your objection responses in an IRAC format. Google that. Very straightforward. \r\n\r\nJudge Lesicko was helping you out in my opinion. \r\n\r\nDont say "like". Don't be intimidated by the judge.	Good call on the hearsay objection, but you should: \r\n1: Follow IRAC like I mentioned above. \r\n2. Be more assertive and confident. This is INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY!!! \r\n\r\nI'd fight much more for the hearsay objections. \r\n\r\nDon't ask open-ended questions! "You haven't seen any updates" , not "did you see". "Isn't it true" instead of "Is it true." \r\n\r\nLoop your witness's answers. "Ms. Kaminsky, on direct you mentioned an encounter with Mr. Cameroon Poole, I'd like to talk about that. You actually talked to Mr. Poole, right?" I'm not sure I like that cross question. You're incriminating your client as well right? "A few friends" can include Bowman. \r\n\r\nWhy not cross Kaminsky on what a shady character she is? Her witness statements literally suggests she doesn't care about the law. Keeps her mouth shut for money.	8	7	8	7	Ah, they all had good backgrounds, I was hoping you would be in costume. 这个背景就有点单调了，black and white photos and diplommas? Please don't fidget while sitting. I noticed immediately. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend using a PPT/demo talking about your "RED" method. It would immediately make you look professional and score points. You have so many exhibits to your disposal. \r\n\r\nConsidering linking your answers. "My grandpa was a cop, my dad was a cop, my brothers are cops. I wanted to be a doctor, but nope, I'm a cop too." ... "Well, this is a chance to be a doctor and a cop together blah blah" \r\n\r\nI like your analogy a lot. "To put it in simple terms..." Hand gestures are great too.	Don't be hostile on cross. "yes ma'am" sounds much better than "go ahead". You sound quite different from your character on direct. \r\n\r\nYou're energetic on direct, and cross you sound perhaps bored or slightly annoyed? I think on key questions you HAVE TO fight. "you're supposed to investigate both sides" "you didn't investigate both sides" "you're friends with the other side" "this wasn't a formal investigation" These are questions that you outta fight. \r\n\r\nBowman lied to you multiple times. That's sufficient.	You have the best camera setup amongst attorneys right now. \r\n\r\nSame comment for you regarding not having demos. You guys know your stuff, make it even better. Ah I think you're having some internet issues, 音画不同步。\r\n\r\nThey're not messages Poole sent to Kimball, they were sent to Bowman. The conspiracy HAS NOT BEEN PROVED. We are here in trial exactly to prove whether or not there has been a conspiracy.. "No further questions" instead of "no more further questions"	I think you're missing objections. How does the witness know that "people are FLOODING in the park?" If Kimball is an expert regarding financial crimes, can he give expert conclusions regarding robberies? \r\n\r\nThe conspiracy HAS NOT BEEN PROVED. We are here in trial exactly to prove whether or not there has been a conspiracy! Argue! Next time you'll know what to say. "Furthermore, these messages are out of context. We haven't heard ANY FOUNDATION to the context of these messages. We don't know what they mean. To try to admit these messages without context and foundation is extremely prejudicial to the members of the jury." (could still lose the objection)\r\n\r\nYou don't need the witness' permission to ask questions. Be confident! You got this. Cross is a little too long. I'm confused to what you want out of this witness.	8	8	7	8	Fantastic intro. I'm not sure if y'all looked at judging paradigms tho, Judge Lesicko specially wrote that he doesn't like "big characters". I'm not sure if you've made adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe dad part is irrelevant.  Very energetic. I think the problem with this witness is I don't understand what she brings to D's case in chief? That can be made clearer via attorney signposting. It becomes clearer as you talk about gangsters.	Maintained same character. Still smiling a lot. Very good. "About yey distance", good answer, but does it help your side? Don't be over eager to explain things.	The dad part is irrelevant. I'm really against questions on direct such as "can you elaborate" A direct is supposed to be like a chat over coffee, and that question is kinda like "你还有啥好说的“ ”你能不能仔细解释下？“”你啥意思？“\r\n\r\nNone of the attorneys really smile.. "Ms. Haley Floyd, do you recognize him?" \r\n\r\nDon't comment on your witness's answers. . the "so scary" part is totally irrelevant and objectionable.	It's a very simple cross. I might talk about how she brought garbage to her boss too. Sometimes short is powerful.	10	7	7	8	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. This is fantastic. And that make up. "You're dad is a deadbeat" LOL. I have NEVER seen somebody use a baby as a prop. You just can't do that in offline trials. I think this intro worked perfectly. \r\n\r\nI think you can focus on how normal it is for Bowman to switch rides with you, you weren't surprised. I like this current line too, you guys seem to be going full power that Longstreet is a liar.	I don't like the part where people's memories go bad after pregenancy. Don't give long answers for everything. When you repeatedly talk about the babies and ex husbands, it's no longer interesting. You're explaining way too much.	Don't comment after an answer -- "that's nice of them" Again, better signposting is required. Match your witness' tone too. You did a decent job allowing her to shine, but you need to direct her more. \r\n\r\nI think the overall issue with defense case in chief is, while in opening you talk about some inside job, the testimony can be all over the place. Lacks focus. \r\n\r\nYou are missing objections! Protect your witness!	I like the narrative objection just to interrupt their flow. I'm going to anticipate this is gonna be a hard witness to cross. Especially when you seem so tense. Think about what you might do if this was a crying witness. Or if she wasn't so cheerful but complained about the hardships of life. \r\n\r\nOk I like the tone a lot. \r\n\r\nHmm you actually come up and apologize. Why are you sorry, what are you sorry for? Don't interrupt the witness. I	7	7	7	8	Ugh, I'm familiar with this case. I really don't like it if students are portraying that Bowman and Poole were in a romantic, and potentially abusive relationship. I think it's just slightly over the line of "invention of facts". I do appreciate your acting skills tho! Normally, I would score this witness very low given your tactics. I'm not doing that for your role, but I should let you know that you might get AMTA judges who feel the same way. \r\n\r\n Ok, now it's getting weird. You're saying that you clearly saw, Winston Thomas, trying to kill "the love of your life", isn't that going to hurt your case tremendously? Doesn't that make it more likely that you INTENTIONALLY switched off the lights? \r\n\r\nMuscle memory. I would cross you like this. Ms. Bowman, that's a button, right? You push a button? That's a lever, you don't push it, you pull it down, correct? You keep on getting disconnected, I lost some of your answers. \r\n\r\nDoes the knife part matter? Is it robbery 1 against Floyd?	Only fight on answers that are really necessary. When a witness "over-explains", that usually signals some sort of guilt. Your screen is pretty much completely frozen at this time. \r\n\r\nA lot of your answers are hurting your case. You're aware of everything, but you still helped him right? Does loving somebody mean it's okay to break the law?\r\n\r\nWas almost impeached on fingerprints. Need to think of a plan to address questions for that.	I just realized I don't know if D is admitting theft by deception. P attorney should make note of that during pre-trial. \r\n\r\nIf your witness is obviously frozen, you should tell the judge that's the case and politely ask to wait. \r\n\r\nExhibit 11 is already entered, and the judge also explained during pretrial that you don't have to ask permission. Just pull it up and make note of it. \r\n\r\nHer internet connection is really bad. Your team has to do tech checks. Smart of you to ask her to re-answer the question.  Yeah the witness definitely can't talk about why she thinks she's being charged. She can only talk about her own agency and rational perceptions.	I don't think any foundation is lacking? Got confused by that objection. \r\n\r\nMuscle memory. I would cross you like this. Ms. Bowman, that's a button, right? You push a button? That's a lever, you don't push it, you pull it down, correct? \r\n\r\nBe careful of genders. It's not just speculation, it's also irrelevant. I'd probably renew the objection with that question. \r\n\r\nFinally! Messages are highlighted!	9	I like your demeanor tremendously.  I think the next steps are to work on your delivery. Vocal variations can help you and pauses as well. Only move with purpose. For instance, right now, you're kinda pacing back and forth. My students at the collegiate level would go as far as timing when they should have certain time gestures. \r\n\r\nIn terms of content, the intro paragraph was good. However, for a long closing argument, it's easy for the jury to lose track of what you're saying. This is why you might want to use your demos/exhibits, and add more emotions at necessary points. \r\n\r\nThe shadow behind you is also just a tiny bit annoying. But I'm nitpicking.	8	*this is a case about power.\r\n\r\nI mentioned this in the bowman comments, I'm not fond of referring to abusive relationships. However, I think talking about power, or abused power by authorities is fine, and a theme that people will resonate with. The issue is, I don't hear a very clear case in chief via your directs and crosses. Your testimonies and exhibits aren't focused clear enough to align with your closing arguments. For instance, in your closing, you shouldn't be just arguing, but telling us which testimonies and what evidence that actually appeared in this trial is supporting your argument.	38	36	14	19	221	20	216	18	220	15	t
190	9	Fine job of drawing our attention to the text message and discussing how it really goes a long way to demonstrate that Poole and Bowman were part of a team.\r\n\r\nOutstanding job of giving us the story regarding what happened to Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe three claims that you say you will prove does a fine job of meeting the burden with respect to robbery, but those contentions don't seem to establish much with respect to the theft by deception charge.	8	Nice job on the burden and reasonable doubt.  Might sprinkle in a discussion of the presumption of innocence\r\n\r\nNice job of focusing our attention on three simple questions  (Not sure that the second question is central to the trial.  It seems possible for Bowman to be complicit even if Bowman doesn't get any of the proceeds of either crime.)\r\n  \r\n   I think the opening should be giving us some reason that Bowman was at the ToT...	7	7	7	5	You go through the "not operate the Tunnel of Terror" point too quickly and it is not tightly connected to the accident...the damning fact gets lost in blizzard of less important facts\r\n\r\nA map would certainly help us understand where the exit door is	Do you really need the "white people" comments to construct this character?	It certainly takes a long time to connect this discussion of wristbands and profits to a crime....It would certainly be more dramatic to start with discovering the park was losing money and then work backwards to the reason for the loss\r\n\r\n  This direct suffers from it being a story that is told in more or less chronological order...there are more interesting ways of arranging the facts so as to keep our attention.	The cross should be focused on a few clear topics..  As it is, it is  difficult to understand why you are asking about some of these topics. \r\n\r\nWork on shorter questions.	5	7	6	8	There is really no reason for these extremely long answers at the start of the direct.\r\n\r\nYou could do more to explain what happens when the ride is put in "blackout" mode.  \r\n\r\nThese long answers make it difficult for us to get clear grasp of whatever facts you are supposed to be introducing.   Your character is almost counter-productive when it comes to bringing out information.	Nice job of not fighting on cross and giving considerably shorter answers than we saw on direct.	We aren't given a real reason to care about the control panel.   You aren't connecting what this witness is saying to what matters at the trial.  I am sure that it is clear in your mind, but you aren't making an effort to give us a context for this testimony.\r\n\r\nBowman lied and this witness got fired for listening to Bowman's lies.  That is a fact that doesn't come through  clearly in this testimony.  We don't get a real sense of how desperate Bowman was to get control of the ToT.\r\n\r\nPoole's knowledge of Bowman running the ToT is an important fact that isn't developed.  You ask the question and end the direct.  How do you expect us to remember the testimony with such a cursory discussion of the fact?	Good job of establishing that it is possible to make a mistake with the controls.  Fine job of making use of the gunshots to make your point.	8	7	8	7	Use the map to show the location of the exit by the ToT\r\n\r\nNice job of explaining how blackout mode might have helped Poole.	Nice job of dealing with the "not finding any money" on August 30	Nice job of using the rules to defend giving the conclusion before you provide the backing for those claims.\r\n\r\nI seriously doubt that any expert gets to opine on a suspect's guilt.   That would seem to invade the province of the jury.\r\n\r\nFine job of trying to get the witness to translate the facts that are implied by the text message.  Nice plan, but the witness's execution of the move is a bit messy and not really developed.	I think you can object to a conclusion that says that someone has committed the crime.  That is what the jury is here to decide and that sets up a few objections that ought to have surfaced.	8	7	7	9	A broader range of emotions would be helpful.   \r\n\r\nI also think that you want to work on vocal variety.  All too often, your answers sound the same.  You should try to vary things like rate, pitch, and volume as a way of drawing attention to key parts of your testimony.  Use your voice to clue the audience in to the fact that you are sharing some "good stuff" and they should be listening even more carefully to what is about to transpire.\r\n\r\nYou do a nice job with the panic part of the direct.	You are the defendant, a defendant fighting for your freedom.  There are times where you can fight back in ways that other witnesses can't.   They need to be seen as disinterested fact witnesses.  You obviously have a dog in this fight.	We really could use a straightforward denial and reasons that support the witness's denial.   This really should be more akin to a speech that supports the defendant's denial and explains away the bad facts.    The attorney is there to throw softball questions to the witness, questions that give rise to a powerful and credible denial of the charges against her.\r\n\r\nThere are too many small topics.  This is organized more like a grocery list and a fleshed-out outline with a few Roman numerals and some subordinate points.\r\n\r\nI think the direct might have done more to bring out the bad facts that are certain to surface on cross.  By not discussing the bad facts,  the crossing attorney gets a chance to score points by bringing in various surprises.\r\n\r\nAs it is, your witness got carved up on cross.  This was certainly a place where a redirect would have been a good idea.	Might have made it clearer that the witness more or less recruited Poole to work at the park.  \r\n\r\nGreat job on the "paying for your meals" pocket of the cross.\r\n\r\nAnd a great job of unpacking the hidden meanings of the various texts.  \r\n\r\nNot sure you get as much mileage as you could out of Bowman's lies to Issacs and Kimball.  That she lied is something you probably want to discuss in the closing.	6	6	6	7	You need to slow down.  \r\n\r\nThere are many times where the answers are too long.  They go beyond the scope of the questions and	Obviously, you were successfully impeached for inventing facts that were not in your  statement.	The start of the direct is quite confusing.  It is not clear why you are calling this witness.   \r\n\r\nHow do these "weird things" relate to the defense's theory of the case?   How is this connected to the preview of your case that we got in the opening?   I don't think that we have been given any sort of framework for dealing with these revelations.	Reaonably good job on the impeachment by omission.. Might make sure that you get the witness to acknowledge that the statement was made under oath \r\n\r\nThe cross needs a tighter organization...you seem to jump from topic to topic...the topic of the bracelets in the trash is discussed at a couple of different points	7	7	7	8	The dialect is in interesting, but you need to be able to inject some vocal variety into the performance.  The test of an accent is the talent of doing an accent and making it have the hallmarks of conversation with variations in rate, pitch, and volume.  As it is, almost every answer sounds very much like the answer that came before it and the one that followed it.	You need to work on sustaining the dialect on cross...it might still be East European, but it ain't the same accent you were doing on direct.   And it keeps changing as the cross continues.	It takes you a very long time to get to the events of August 30.   This direct seems as if far more effort went into developing the character than went into carefully crafting a direct that highlights the facts that the witness is supposed to relay.\r\n\r\nI don't think the defense has given us a reason to care about the "meeting at the bar"    Not sure we have a clue as to why that fact helps your side.	A very solid cross\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the overheard phone calls is much longer and less pointed than it should be.  You have many questions in this pocket that are unnecessary	9	You have great pace at the start of this speech...slow, measured and demonstrates how thoughtful and careful you are.  A great job of using delivery to enhance your ethos.\r\n\r\nExcellent job of outlining complicity\r\n\r\nCould have done more to describe how blackout mode helped Poole\r\n\r\nYou could probably get more out of the "Thanks" message and what we can infer from that particular message.  \r\n\r\nREBUTTAL:  This is too scattered and the witness-by-witness attack isn't all that powerful.  In a rebuttal, you have time to focus on only one big thing.	7	The closing needs to be responsive to what happened in the trial.  You need to be coming to grips with the text messages and the way in which the prosecution has used them to draw some very reasonable inferences that the two of them were working together.\r\n\r\n  If Bowman had the intention to assist Poole, that is probably what the statute and case law seem to require\r\n\r\n   Your explanation as to why she opened the door is quite confusing.  \r\n\r\n   Why is actually getting money from a crime an element that matters when complicity is at issue?   I think you have a burden here that isn't the same as the burden we get from the law.\r\n\r\n      Does the law require "intention to harm" or merely "intention to assist"?	45	97	21	26	149	150	23	152	22	151	t

213	6	I like that you start with your theme. I really like the use of the demonstratives during opening. You should modulate your voice a little more - louder at times/quieter at times. Your opening is a little argumentative, make sure you are using terms like, "You will hear .." and "The evidence will show".	8	Good, strong voice. Good use of hand motions. Good job attacking the prosecution's burden. I like using demo's during opening, but I would leave them open a little longer.	7	6	6	8	I like the character and costuming. There were some clever answers in there on your direct as well. You're pretty fast on some of your answers and I would encourage you to slow down. Good use of body language while testifying, makes you more engaging.	Good job not being too defensive on cross. I think you could have elaborated a bit more though to try to take control from the attorney.	Make sure that you are following the judge's lead. I really like your team's use of visuals, it makes it clear for the jury. I'm not sure why you aren't watching the camera the entire time, it appears that you may be reading your next question while the witness is answering - try not to do this.	Good objections, it differentiates you from your opposing counsel when you clearly know the evidence code and can argue admissibility. Good cross questions and witness control.	6	6	7	8	It appears that you are reading and that really hurts your delivery. Your a little fast on some responses and need to switch up your tone a little here and there.	Not too defensive for cross, which is good, but as an expert you have more freedom to explain your answers.	Good tone for direct examination and good questions to establish expertise. Good job responding to objections. I like the use of demonstratives.	Good objections. Slow down a little in arguing your objections, you know the evidence code and can apply the facts, but you go a little fast and trip yourself up. Good cross tone.	6	6	7	6	Careful with body motion, and putting your hand in front of your face. You are also pretty fast at times and there were times where you were very loud.	Answers weren't too defensive for the most part. Good facial expressions while you thought about answers.	Good use of demonstrative. Tone is good for direct, but your questions are a little fast. I liked your argument regarding the statement against interest hearsay objection and the statement of mind exception.	Careful looking off screen too often, it makes you look like you are not confident. Slow down to smooth out your objection arguments and responses.	8	7	8	7	Good job mixing up your tone depending on the answer. I would suggest a chair that doesn't swivel. There were times where you could have slowed down just a little.	Good job giving the impression that you are thinking through your cross questions. Good pace.	Good wrapping around with your questions to keep us oriented on what the testimony is addressing. Good movement for Zoom to keep us engaged.	Good tone for cross. Good witness control.	8	6	7	8	Good character with nice energy. Really good body language and hand motion to make your character believable as a real person and not too scripted.	I think you should work on your cross answers. You lost a bit of your positive energy from direct and were pretty defensive.	Good inquisitive tone for direct exam. Careful commenting after your witness testifies (saying things like, "very well"). Careful with your tone as you argue an objection.	I liked your character objection, but make sure that you can back it up when she says it should be admissible. Good job on the objections brought up on cross exam. Good tone for cross.	7	6	8	8	Good facial expression and tone for a defendant. You come across and apologetic. I do think there were times where it would have helped to slow down. Careful with word choice ("hot mess" is not a good term to use while a defendant in a criminal trial).	You got a little slower and quieter on cross. As the defendant, this comes across like you're guilty/defeated - be careful with that.	I like your movement for Zoom and good use of demonstratives to stay engaging. It is a little hard to see the text messages on the demo. Good inquisitive tone for most questions. Good objections to interrupt opposing counsel's flow on cross-exam.	I like cross exams that start with a hard question, but I think you can rephrase that "Ms. Bowman, you lied 5 times during the investigation of this case, right".	7	Careful with your movement during closing. It's good to move with purpose to stay engaging, but there were times where you were swaying a bit. Good, strong tone for closing. Good strategy to bring up the lying during rebuttal.	7	Good movement and good tone for closing. I would encourage you to use more direct evidence that we heard - direct us to specific testimony from specific witnesses rather than just telling us the story, which sometimes comes across as scripted. Good use of a demonstrative during closing.	46	154	80	76	154	158	81	77	156	82	t
134	7	Give a bit more of a story and really lure me in. You do a little bit of this already, but really tell me about the background and tell me more about the theft. Maybe start with the theft and then rewind back. \r\n\r\nOverall good tone variation, but focus more on your lows/soft voices. And give me more pauses and really let things sink in. \r\n\r\nYou do have a theme, but really try to hammer it more. Sprinkle it in more if you can, or really slow done/pause when saying it.	6	Give me your side of the story. What actually happened according to you? Although you say that the government won't be able to meet their burden of proof, but give me what you think happened. \r\n\r\nOverall good tone variation, but focus more on your lows/soft voices. And give me more pauses and really let things sink in. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you have a theme, but if you do you really need to hammer it and make sure you tell me what it is. Make sure you end with it and really make sure the judges grasp it. Sprinkle it in more if you can, or really slow done/pause when saying it.	7	5	7	7	Careful of not shaking your head during objection battles, whether its a good or a bad thing for your side. \r\n\r\nMake sure to try to stay in character and play up the stereotypical police officer or detective. I think a serious tone is good.	But careful to not appear too bias to one side, just stick to the facts of what you found.\r\n\r\nDon't ask to be called detective kimball. It makes you seem stuffy and pretentious.	How did you reliably apply these methods? Rephrase into did you reliably apply these methods? Because your question assumes they did reliably apply these methods. \r\n\r\nTry looping more. By looping I mean repeat the answers the witness gives you that are really good for you and put it in your next question. \r\n\r\nWhos phone was it? Try do you know who's phone was it? So again you don't assume the knowledge the witness has. \r\n\r\nMake note of what the judge says in pretrial. I said to ask for permission, but you kept saying "for the record"	"Later determined he must be Cameron Pool" object to speculation objection?\r\n\r\nGood leading questions, but be mindful of making comments like that's a yes or sure. You don't need to insert your comments in. \r\n\r\n"Longstreet did not pay well" is this in the affidavit? Can you impeach? Can you bring in the witness to say yes. These are your words, right?\r\n\r\nWhich conversation? You can point them to one specific conversation or open it up to all the conversations. \r\n\r\nBe careful of going too far with far with conclusions. For example, it's a possibility... Unless its in their affidavit and they have to agree then go for it.	6	8	7	8	Be careful of improperly publishing documents to the jury. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you're reading your direct, but try to be off script if you can. And at minimum try to be mindful of your eyes.	Good responsive to her questions since there is no wiggle room.\r\n\r\nGood staying in character, but try to incorporate some more jokes here during cross if you can like you have in your direct.	I'm not sure about some people don't think highly of me. It opens it up to a speculation objection or a lack of foundation objection since it's what other people are saying. \r\n\r\nTry looping a bit more. Repeat the good parts of the witness testimony in your next question.	"I found out that bowman..." Object to lack of foundation? \r\n\r\nGood clear short questions. \r\n\r\nAfter an objection make sure you get your answer to the question you asked.\r\n\r\nBe mindful of saying "sure" in between your questions	7	7	7	7	Good character, very likable, very high energy. \r\n\r\nBut we need a bit more character that you introduced early in your direct and keep that up.	Be mindful of which questions you really want to fight and which you don't. \r\n\r\nIf they don't hurt you there is no need to fight the question. \r\n\r\nBut good on fighting on some questions where they attack your credibility.	Ask about what it means to be a bookkeeper.  What are her duties? How does she keep the books? Give me more information here. \r\n\r\nGood bouncing back from objections. Even though they were sustained you seemed unbother and kept going. Good!\r\n\r\n403 is hard to win be careful when making these objections. It has to be substantially more prejudicial than probative and anything going to the witness's credibility tends to be pretty probative. \r\n\r\nIf the witness is handling a line of questioning well like the 100% line I think just let them handle it.	Object to it was cameron pool who sold/swapped the wrist bands. Speculation?\r\n\r\nGood short questions. \r\n\r\nNot sure what the point of asking about the records was without entering it in with the witness and asking about the amounts. But maybe we'll see them later. \r\n\r\n"You can't be 100%?" is that in the affidavit? Otherwise don't ask because the witness can say they were sure.	6	7	7	7	Careful of speaking too fast. Pace is important to let the members of the jury process all of the information you're giving. Even when you're talking about your character you can speak slower.	Not bad, but just make sure you stay in character.	I know that you want to preempt the firing, but it seems that it takes a bit before you get into the actual good parts of your direct. I might try to get into the bracelets ect sooner if possible. \r\n\r\nTry to loop the previous witness answer if it's good for you. \r\n\r\nBut good clear questions.	Good slow and clear pace. \r\n\r\nDon't ask open-ended questions on cross. Don't ask the witness to explain what things mean. You tell the witness what something means. \r\n\r\nDon't end with open-ended questions, tell them the answer you're looking for.	8	7	8	8	Good enthusiastic character. Good clear pace. Good speaking with your hands and being animated. \r\n\r\nMake sure you aren't flustered and just keep going when objections are sustained.	Be mindful of staying in character and really choosing your battles. You need to pick what exactly you want to fight on cross and otherwise be responsive on cross.	Good clear tone and pace. \r\n\r\nTry looping more. Repeating the good parts of the witness testimony in your next question and combining them. \r\n\r\nGood bouncing back from objections.	Move to strike when you win an objection. You did it the second time, but make sure you do the first. \r\n\r\nCareful about asking about the contents of the employee manual and getting a best evidence objection. Asking about their knowledge might be ok. \r\n\r\nGood witness control. \r\n\r\nGood clear short questions. \r\n\r\nDon't ask the witness if another witness lied because it can go either way. It just depends on who the witness believes and which the witness thinks is the liar. Just lay out the facts for the jury to decide.	7	7	7	7	I'm not 100% if you are using an accent but it seems to phase in and out. I think your regular voice is fine. I don't think you need a character here for the defendant, but rather just be believable and being somebody the jury can have empathy.	Let your attorney object to hearsay if they improperly impeach you if its not something that makes sense or you can't elaborate on. \r\n\r\nCareful about over-elaborating. You can get away with it more than other witnesses because you're the defendant but, still be mindful of getting out of attorney mode and getting into only witness mode.	Make sure you are paying attention to which exhibits have already been admitted from the prosecution so you don't have to enter them again. \r\n\r\nSlow down. And use voice inflection. Be more inquisitive at his answers. \r\n\r\nLoop the witness answers if you can.	Make sure you ask for permission to screen share if the judge asks you to. Make note of pretrial things and adjust accordingly. \r\n\r\nMake sure you get the small details. \r\n\r\nFor the first impeachment, I'm not sure how that statement that you read from the affidavit had to do with the impeachment of Cameron Pool. That point was not clear. \r\n\r\nThe second impeachment is close, but its not word for word that this witness did not report Pool because he needed the money. What I would do instead to not get into this whole process is just ask about the facts. \r\nYou didn't report Cameron Pool's scheme.\r\nPool bought you lunch\r\nYou needed money\r\nect.	8	Good simple explanation. Good use of them. But try to use more of your voice inflextion and give me pauses. Slow down and speed up sentences. \r\n\r\nPlay down the burden of proof. \r\n\r\nThe timeline could've been done a bit slower. \r\n\r\nGood use of your theme again in the rebuttal and countering what the defense said.	8	Is there a solid theme? Can this be reiterated more or made clearer to the jury? \r\n\r\nGood playing up the burden of proof. Make it seem like its almost insurmountable. And good deflecting to Pool. \r\n\r\nMake more use of dramatic pauses.	30	126	22	21	99	104	24	102	26	103	t
172	7	I like the theme but I think you could do a bit more to weave it into the rest of the opening.\r\n\r\nYou explain the individual facts well, but overall this opening feels somewhat choppy, you could work on flowing a bit more smoothly from one line to the next.	8	I really like how clear you are about what you are and are not disputing in this case, makes your theory feel precise and intentional.\r\n\r\nYour theme is a bit generic but it gets the job done.\r\n\r\nGood use of screensharing the three key facts, helped them stand out.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you want to make timing a very important issue in the case, but from the opening I'm not super clear about why it matters or what the timeline is going to show.	9	9	8	9	Fun character, I like your consistency in sticking with the performance even in objection arguments.\r\n\r\nGood job having variation in tone even within the voice you used for the character.	Kept the character up well on cross, your elaborations didn't feel too evasive of fighty.	Good hearsay response on the financial document, sorry for the weird wording of my ruling, that wasn't your fault.\r\n\r\nThis direct proceeds in a straightforward way, the sequence of questions makes sense.\r\n\r\nI don't think your response to the lack of foundation objection worked because the witness didn't actually say she heard this fact from Kimball.	Great objections, they had reasonable logic behind them and worked well to break up the flow of the direct. Very clear response to relevance.\r\n\r\nYour cross was very efficient, went directly for the points you need and made them strongly.	7	6	8	9	Your character seemed professional and you knew your facts, but I think if the delivery was a bit more confident it could have been more persuasive.	I think some of these responses could use a bit of work to better deflect the attacks on your investigation. At a couple points you seem to get pushed into agreeing with points that you might have been able to explain away.\r\n\r\nI like the bit of sadness on the question	Very good job clarifying some of those objection issues, like how the factors listed in Tarot Readers are just examples and the opinion being about Cameron's theft-by-deception not the defendant's.	I like the 702 objection, I think you probably stretched the law and facts a little bit to make it work but you did it in a strategic way.\r\n\r\nSome very strong cross points, you do a great job of attacking the credibility of her investigation.	7	8	9	8	I wasn't really sure what you were going for with this character, I don't think the emotions or overall concept came across super clearly. But you did make a substantial choice and committed to it, and I think that made it fairly interesting to listen to.	You stuck with the character on cross, and I think the personality even worked a bit better for cross responses for direct because you could lean into the casual and haphazard tone when you didn't have to string together a complete story. Made some of the questions not land as strongly as they otherwise might have.	Great job with that 804b3 response, I'm a big fan of the declarant unavailable exceptions and wish they got used more if only for the surprise factor. Your other hearsay response was strong as well.\r\n\r\nI liked the tone and phrasing of your questions on this direct, helped me follow along with the witnesses story.	Very good job taking the time to think through that unexpected hearsay response and compare it to the witness's answer, you managed to catch them on a point where I agree it didn't quite apply.\r\n\r\nYour baseline cross tone and style lands quite well, just make sure you don't get thrown off when the witness doesn't give you the answer you're looking for.	9	9	8	6	This performance is subtle but I really like it, I think you make this character especially easy to relate to and your story easy to understand.	Great job not going along with him on those strange questions about whether a normal person could make mistakes, he was definitely trying to get you to agree to things you didn't have to.	Great tone for direct. \r\n\r\nI think you had a good instinct to object to that line of questioning about whether a normal person could make mistakes on the ride, I just don't think relevance was the way to go. Improper opinion or argumentative might have worked better.	If you're going to cross on the button layouts you might want to use the pictures. I think without them it was still fine, but not an especially impactful point.\r\n\r\nWhen I overruled the objection you just moved on — might have been a good idea since the point had gotten messy, but it does make it look like you're backing off.	7	6	8	8	I'd like to see more emotion when you get to the part of the story where you were threatened, you have a couple good moments but in general I don't think you do quite enough to make it distinct from your delivery of the rest of the direct.	Careful with how you choose to fight, try to pick specific points where you can disagree with or clarify a fact. If you seem hesitant to answer a lot of questions without being able to dispute something of substance, it'll make you seem a bit evasive.	Great job with that character evidence response! But once it was overruled you probably should have reasked the question to get a strong ending, especially because I don't think the witness had finished her answer.	Bold choice to go after the sad witness for having a motive to make up her story. I'm not totally sure about how it fits in with the rest of your case — are you disputing this whole incident, or just specific parts of it that incriminate Bowman? But you deliver that pocket well and it makes for a pretty strong and memorable cross point.	8	7	9	10	I thought your acting at the start when you admit to the theft by deception could have been a bit more realistic, it felt kind of scripted. \r\n\r\nBut when you got to hearing the gunshot at the ride and panicking it felt much more real, great job bringing up the tension of that crucial moment.\r\n\r\nSome nice ways of explaining your actions on the day of the robbery.	Had to back off from some of the ways you tried to fight, but overall you handled it well and didn't get too combative or lose your composure.\r\n\r\nThe pull vs. press distinction seemed like you were trying to avoid the question.\r\n\r\nGood answer to the last question.	Very nice delivery of your questions, helped draw out the story in a clear and conversational way.\r\n\r\nGood use of "this is very important to clarify for the members of the jury" to highlight a key fact.\r\n\r\nI think you put too many words on this timeline demo, if it had a bit less it might be easier to keep track of.	Huge fan of the way you come out of the gate swinging with a nonchalant "you are a liar, right?"\r\n\r\nGreat job controlling the witness in a way that's responsive to the answers she just gave.\r\n\r\nGood try with the asked and answered objection.	8	Love the focus on the victim for the story at the start of your closing.\r\n\r\nYour walkthrough of the background before the robbery felt a bit awkward and fumbling. \r\n\r\nI feel like you can make a bigger rhetorical point out of how the defendant has admitted to a huge part of this scheme.\r\n\r\nI like the focus on the defendant's lies but be careful not to go around in circles.	8	"Never tried to cover anything up" is maybe a bit of an overstatement given that you're admitting to theft by deception.\r\n\r\nThe way you escalate your pace and tone as you build up to "in that moment of chaos" is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe bit at the end about humanity being capable of improvement was surprisingly wholesome and earnest for a closing argument, probably not a style most would suggest but I enjoyed it.	46	130	76	154	158	80	81	156	82	159	t
136	7	Great pace...Slow and measured.  \r\n\r\nThe map would be useful in helping us see the action that took place leading to Officer Thomas's injury.\r\n\r\nYour discussion of the bracelet scheme (in the section before you preview the witness testimony( is quite sparse and confusing.  \r\n\r\nMight focus our attention on the fact that the defendant had no reason to be at the controls of the ride.\r\n\r\nYou race through the "Thanks"  much too quickly.  That is actually a damning piece of evidence.	6	The notion that it is an "inside job" might be introduced earlier in the speech and you really need to flesh out the implications of that claim.  At the minimum, you would be arguing that there was no robbery because Floyd willingly parted with the money.\r\nYou need to give us some reason that Longstreet would fake a robbery.\r\n\r\nCould do more to talk about the defendant being confused and panic-stricken.	9	8	9	7	An excellent character.   Great job of varying your rate, pitch, and volume to draw attention to critical facts and make your testimony interesting.  It sounds like a real conversation.\r\n\r\nNice job of showing appropriate emotion regarding Thomas\r\n\r\nYour description of the maintanence mode is pretty sparse.  Is there some reason that the park would want to have the ride moving around in the dark?	Nice job on the re-direct.	Given what you heard from the defense's opening, you should be making some adjustments in the direct to deal with the accusation that it was an "inside job"\r\n\r\nNice job of shrinking the discussion of how the ticket scheme worked and how it was uncovered by replacing Poole   A very efficient direct on this topic\r\n\r\nThe idea that Bowman wasn't supposed to be running the ride could be developed in more dramatic fashion.	I am not seeing the point of your questions about the "attack" on Floyd.\r\n\r\nThis cross needs to be more tightly connected to the claims about the "inside job" that was featured so prominently in the opening statement.	7	7	7	7	A very engaging character.\r\n\r\nOften your answers are a bit too long and that makes it difficult for the key facts to stand out.  There are times where you are drifting into a long narrative and you are going beyond what is required to answer the question.\r\n\r\nYou really need to break up the contents of the first phone call so that we are getting the conversation line by line and each important fact is looped into the next question.  Give us at least two chances to hear each important fact in the phone conversation.		You could get to August 30 more directly.  \r\n\r\nThink about the implications of your objections.  Why object to something that helps your case.	This would be a more effective cross if you were discussing the second phone call rather than spending a lot of time on the witness's general experiences with the park.\r\n\r\nYou need to do more to emphasize the "meet at bar" part of the conversation,.  It should be more than a solitary question and answer sequence.	8	7	7	6	The "RED_ methodology really isn't doing very much to enhance your credibility.  As mock trial tricks go, it is a pretty cheap trick.\r\n\r\nNice job of interpreting the text messages so that we grab their importance.		Why are you having this witness spending so much time on the ticket scam?  Your first witness did a fine job of spelling out the scheme and there is little need to have this witness cover much the same ground.  You should be focusing on what this witness can tell us about the way in which Bowman is connected to the scheme.  This is a  very inefficient (and often confusing) part of the direct.	Try to figure out the major points that you want on cross    There are a lot of questions in this cross that get in the way of your major attacks.  EDIT  EDIT AND EDIT SOME MORE\r\n\r\nCross questions should be short.  Yours are much too  long.  Short quesitons let you control the pace of the cross.\r\n\r\nAnd short questions constrain the witness.\r\n\r\nYou have some great ideas, but they get lost because this cross needs drama both in the arrangement of the questions and in the performance of the attorney.  Make more use of your voice and in the pacing of your delivery.\r\n\r\nYou would be well-served by working to be more animated in your delivery.	7	7	7	7	An interesting character.  You need to work on varying your voice more.  Too many of your answers sound the same and that limits your ability to clue us in that some facts matter more than others.    Certainly slowing down for some answers would be a good idea as you are often speaking rather rapidly.		Why are you using this witness to describe the control panel?   That is ground that has been covered by other witnesses.  This witness would seem to be pivotal to the "inside job" part of your case and the time spent on the ride cuts into your ability to flesh out that story.	Good job of focusing on the employee exit at the back of ToT.\r\n\r\n  The arrangement of the cross is somewhat haphazard as you jump from topic to topic	8	7	7	7	A very clever idea for a character.\r\n\r\nGo slower in developing the identification of the possible Poole...one fact per question would help enhance your credibility   Develop the list of similarities bit by bit	There are too many times where you are giving longer answers that were necessary\r\n\r\nYou are coming across as a partisan witness--trying to help Bowman rather than being a disinterested observer\r\n\r\nYou are fighting way too much on cross  and it is harming your credibility	It really takes a bit too long to get to the relevant parts of the testimony.\r\n\r\nNice job of using the "vomit" to provide a seemingly innocent for Bowman wanting to escape working at  the Mind Eraser\r\n\r\nYou really could do more to develop the drama of the bar scene.	The overheard conversation between Floyd and Longstreet should have been hit with a hearsay objection.\r\n\r\nBowman lied to her.  Bowman lied to her to take over the ride.  That is what needs to stand out in the cross\r\n\r\nThe point of the questioning about the blackout mode was not clear\r\n\r\nYou would be better able to control the witness if your questions were shorter.	7	6	6	8	Not sure how having a romantic relationship with Poole really helps to beat back a claim of being complicit in Poole's crimes.  It seems that you are creating a character that makes it harder to sell the idea that you are innocent.  A rather curious dramatic choice.\r\n\r\nThere are wide emotional swings and they are packed so closely together that they undermine your credibility.  Your character has the same problem Amber Heard had in a real life trial.	Your answers often go beyond the question asked and should have been stricken had the attorney objected.	Need to do more to explain what you were doing in the control booth of the ToT\r\n\r\nNeed to give more thought to bringing out the bad facts on direct rather than having those nuggets surfacing on cross   You really leave the witness vulnerable by not addressing things like the fingerprints and the text messages.	The foundation objection about the "incident" seems misdirected.  That the witness was there is not in dispute.  What foundation could be missing?\r\n\r\nFine job of focusing on the text message and making sure that we understand how damning the evidence is.  Well done\r\n\r\nThat the witness lied to Issacs and lied to Kimball is kind of an important fact that your side probably wants for the closing.   I don't think you are making this point clearly.	8	Did she help Poole escape?  That would seem to be the easiest argument for your side to make since Poole can't be found and was last seen entering the ToT....a ride that was under the control of Bowman\r\n\r\nCould be making more use of Bowman's lies  Lies to Issac and Kimball.  Those lies matter in assessing what Bowman said on the stand.\r\n\r\nCould be using the text messages more effectively to show that the two of them were a team\r\n\r\nREBUTTAL  Nice job of explaining why it was not a coincidence that Bowman was at the ToT as Poole was running away from the robbery.	7	How does putting the ride into "blackout" mode help Poole?   Why is plunging Poole into darkness a move that actually assists Poole?  That is an assumption being made by the prosecution that they haven't really explained to us.\r\n\r\nYou probably needed to spend more time having us consider a few facts that don't make a great deal of sense.  You have Longstreet deciding not to do an official investigation even though Longstreet is supposedly losing a lot of money and you have the mysterious meeting in the bar.  Those simple details don't stand out in your story.   If you want to sell a story as complex as the "inside job" tale, you have devote more time to selling that story.  It doesn't really work as an after-thought.\r\n\r\nNice job of arguing that Bowman did not have foreknowledge of Poole's robbery.  \r\n\r\nThe captains' form seems to indicate that the prosecution wasn't pursuing the Floyd robbery in this trial.   You are arguing something that doesn't seem to have been at issue here.	38	97	14	19	20	218	15	216	17	18	t
293	5	"He turned off the lights -- he hides all his lies." An excellent, and catchy theme. \r\nTheft by deception and robbery in the 1st. \r\n\r\nGetting to the what the witnesses will say with only two minutes left is dangerous. The point of the opening is to introduce your case, and you've spent the majority of your presentation not talking about the most salient part of your presentation: the witnesses who will prove your case. \r\nRan over. Which is not surprising given how long it took you to get to the witnesses. It's disappointing because it was a strong open and strong finish, but suffered from bloat in the middle. Your score reflects the fact that you ran over, but isn't wholly indicative of your presentation and content.	7	All he wanted to do is calm his friend down . . . . but might conflict with "it was just an accident"\r\n\r\n100% sure isn't what beyond a reasonable doubt means. \r\nIt's difficult to have a robust discussion of the actual evidence that the jury will hear  if you give yourself less than 2 mins to discuss the witnesses. Everything else becomes very close to argument, which is not appropriate for an opening statement.	7	7	7	7	Clear; concise when necessary, though your answers did get a bit wordy at times. It's difficult to convey character, etc. via Zoom, but I appreciate your attempts to inject energy into the witness. You used your proximity to the camera as a good way to convey your tension and interest in the question.\r\n\r\nHowever, at times it was clear that you were reading. The issue here is that it could be a script, your responses, or simply the Zoom chat. I don't know, but can only assume the worst.	Good, well prepped responses to the Cx questions re: Bowman. There's only so much your character can get you, and you didn't try to go beyond that artificially.	Thanking the witness is usually a no-go; especially in front of a jury. Most judges will prevent you from doing it because it could introduce bias to a case. You aren't the witnesses friend, and in most real-life circumstances would likely have never met this person before. \r\n\r\nYou've got great demeanor/presentation. You're comfortable with your witness and recovered from the internet connectivity issues without any fuss.	Questions are clear, and to the point. \r\n\r\nControlling the witness is difficult in person, and almost impossible with the artificial delay introduced by Zoom. You did well to try.\r\n\r\nYou survived an objection argument but did not follow up on your question to ensure that the response you were looking for was made on the record.	8	6	7	6	Fantastic command of your facts. It's a prerequisite for an "expert" witness and you did well to make it credible. Even if the only thing that came to mind is that Covid would have wrecked the income for any amusement park in 2020.\r\n\r\nThe only issue you an into is the constant fixing/playing with your hair. It's normal and natural, but can at times be distracting as you're performing your role.	Your demeanor completely changed on cross -- which is natural, but can also be a clear telltale that you're being an advocate as opposed to being a neutral witness. Being neutral is one of the highest priorities you would have as a financial investigator.	703 can't be used to way you're invoking it here. It does not allow hearsay statements to come in. There's a way to do this -- that isn't it. I let it in because your command/knowledge of the rule was better than opposing counsel, even if that knowledge was misapplied. You should take pride in that.	So 703 doesn't technically allow an expert to testify to statements that would ordinarily be inadmissible as hearsay. You'll need to brush up on your knowledge of the rule, and how it applies. This should be an easy argument to win.	8	8	7	8	So, I love the background and the swag. It's funny and character appropriate BUT would also be the exact kind of things that an attorney would have asked you to remove in order to appear more professional for court. It's a fine line that's made all the more difficult because of Zoom. Maybe more subtlety would be better for next time.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this witness plays as approachable, personable and high-energy. You did well to craft the character.	You kept your demeanor and energy on cross. That's not easy, and you take pride in the consistency you displayed between direct and cross.	Straight forward and unobtrusive. I like the effort to highlight how often Bowman insisted on taking over the control to the ride. \r\n\r\nIf you wanted to have her talk specifically about "why" her boss would have done something you'll need to give additional foundation as to how she's able to make that rational perception. \r\n\r\nThe hearsay objections aren't bad, though the argument could be cleaned up a bit.\r\n\r\nYou would have done well to follow up on your objection to 11a with similar objections to the subsequent questions. If the exhibit isn't relevant, then the testimony about the controls likely isn't either. -- which is exactly the issue that comes up re: the position of the control button. \r\n\r\n"Misleading the jury" isn't an objection. Relevance, per 403, is the objection. \r\n\r\nI like the rebuttal and pointing out the difference between pushing a button and pulling (or using) a lever. The witness could have given you more with the answer, but the question was a good one.	That's an excellent speculation objection and argument. Well done.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to ask permission to ask the witness questions -- certainly not of the witness. You can formulate a different intro that gives less power to the witness. \r\n\r\nGreat response to the hearsay objection on the "question". The subsequent response to the "All will be well" statement was needlessly long. You had it with not being offered for the truth. The other rationale were superfluous and wrong.\r\n\r\nSome judges will dock you points for not wearing a tie. I won't, but you need to think about that as you continue.	6	6	7	9	At times, the performance was forgettable. I'll give you credit for trying to inject life into the journalist, but so much of the character seemed to be played up as a way to namedrop people or institutions as opposed to it being a reflection of your own personality.		It's a well crafted direct, but suffers from the need to reiterate the witness' testimony. If you have to do that, then it likely wasn't clear enough in the first place.	Your objections weren't bad, per se. However, the improper opinion one was way off base. She's not an expert, and can certainly give her opinion as to what she finds suspicious. Her opinion on the issue might not be relevant, but it's certainly not an improper opinion. \r\n\r\nThat was as good a cross examination as you could have done given the facts and this witness.	8	7	8	9	I'll give you credit for playing into having to go to the bathroom. Assuming it wasn't a planned bit, it wasn't a bad save at all. \r\n\r\nIn your face and outlandish. The arm movements and gestures work well on Zoom, but may be too over the top in person.	My personal preference would have been to deal with the damaging testimony re: the call on direct, though I understand why you structured the examination the way you did. Otherwise it comes off as canned and odd that you're only mentioning this info now.	You absolutely need more foundation on that excited utterance argument. Though, it was clear that you were (i) prepared for it and (ii) were ready to pivot. That's evidence of good planning.	Excellent argument on the hearsay objection to the excited utterance.\r\n\r\nA very well structured and well delivered cross examination. Straight forward and to the point with a clear and strong finish.	6	6	7	7	I know you're encouraged to wear informal attire, but your witness is the defendant. That's the individual whose life is on the line, and who may be looking at jail, prison or other significant consequences (who may no longer be able to publish his comic . . .). He, of everyone, should be taking this very, very seriously.  His testimony is not the time to hawk his comic. \r\n\r\nI'm curious, given how this testimony comes in, why you didn't call this witness to start the defense's case in chief?	I liked the "overwhelmed" and "panicked" bit. It's simple, but effective. \r\n\r\nI did not like the combativeness you displayed on "setting up the plan". It seemed out of place.	It's poor form generally to say, "now witness, this is very important for the jury". Your witness is the defendant. Everything he has to say is of incredible importance to the jury.\r\n\r\nI like the structure and organization of the end of this examination. I wish you had gotten to it sooner.	You're getting bogged down arguing with the witness re: whether he helped set up the plan. He's running away with the response despite the fact that your point is made. Just get to the impeachment using the affidavit and leave it at that. You have all you need for any closing argument.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there's no need to give him a chance to explain the context of the statement from the affidavit.	9	I'm not sure I've heard testimony regarding most of your (otherwise compelling) opening during either your case-in-chief or the defense's. For eg., did anyone testify about a knife?\r\n\r\nOtherwise it's a very strong performance. You command the camera and clearly know your case well.	7	Your formulation of reasonable doubt is not accurate. You're allowed to have doubt. You don't need to be sure. The requirement is that the case be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond all doubt. \r\n\r\nThe way I often think of it is as follows: my doctor recommends that I have major surgery. It could potentially help me avoid some significant medical issues, but comes with a chance of side effects. I have doubts about the side effects, but at the end of the day decide to have the surgery because the benefits outweigh the potential harm. I have proven to myself, beyond a reasonable doubt, that I should do the surgery despite still having doubts, concerns and worries about aspects of it.	77	138	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t
98	7	- I really like your hand motions but I think they need to be more purposeful and less consistent \r\n- I love the way you tied a single word into the elements of the burden \r\n-I think there should be more of a story at the beginning, I know very little about the case and felt as if I didn't until you walked through the witnesses\r\n- Use more pauses to emphasize important parts that will be your best friend\r\n-I like the sense of urgency in your tone but slow down!	9	-I liked the theme!

211	8	Starting with Poole -- this is a really interesting story but it is a little confused. You seems like reading. Talk about Bowman more before the charge. The 3 points are pretty nice. Very nice line-up! Invisible person behind the truth -- interesting. \r\n\r\nA minor point: \r\n- your camera angel is a little weird. I like your hand moves. Be a little far from the camera would be good.	10	Nice performance! I really love it. Cool point on actively be in the plan. This is a strong point. Your 3 points is very clear and well-explained. You create a narrative, and this is so nice! This is a perfect defense opening!	6	6	9	9	You can speak a little slower. It's a little hard to follow you. Some answers are too long. Some answers can lead to a 703 objection. I believe you can know your material better so that you can seems more credible. These answers are too vague and they give your attorney a hard time.	Your energy level seems low for me. Don't mention about enough foundation -- this is a term for lawyer. You act like an attorney, and this is not your job here. Expert witness should be confident with your knowledge and don't care about other things.	Very nice tone. The 702 pocket is fantastic. I like this direct -- you make all the signpost really clear and the timeline is clear. \r\n"yell -- robbery" it is hard to say that the expert have this knowledge of it because of 702. You can have a lot way to deal with this problem such as "Heard the yell and it seems for me like a robbery. But I'm not sure." This is definitely a 703.	"In the shadow" that seems like a metaphor but your objection point is nice. \r\n"yell -- robbery"  objection. This could be a 703 objection. Use this to challenge 702 ground is weird and hard. If you would like to challenge 702, do it early. \r\nYour objection is strong. Stating someone is lying -- I think this is more like a character evidence objection. 704 is hard to argue. \r\n\r\nCross: \r\nReally nice questions! The you-don't-know pocket is a nice one and I love it. Your line-up is perfect.	7	7	7	9	It's a little hard to follow you but you have a character -- this is nice. You are really answering the question from your attorney.	You handle the first pocket well. However, don't be too aggressive for the other attorney. I think every witness in your team has this problem, but don't say "you can say that", at least not that often. You seems a little flighty but overall it is fine.	Your questions are clear. Your hearsay objection responses are good -- be more confident. Overall this  is a really nice direct. You looks like reading from the script.\r\n\r\nYou can object on 403 during the tax pocket. Whether your witness is guilty or not should not affect his credibility.	Your second hearsay objection is awesome. You know what you are objecting for.\r\n\r\nCross: \r\nI love your tone. You are professional. You have a really nice control over your witness. The line-up of your pocket is awesome. The tax-history pocket is nice.	6	6	7	7	Your energy level seems so low. Have some character would be good. Remember, in the trial, you are Billy Isaacs. You should be more energetic with emotion, and know your materials better.	Your energy level is a little up during cross. Though you seems a little impatient during cross.\r\nYou can improve a lot on your character.	There are a lot hearsay quotes from the answers. Some of this can be described differently. Your questions are good. Your responses of hearsay is fine, but you can be more careful in direct.\r\n\r\nObjection on impeachments \r\n-- improper impeachments -- hearsay. You should let the impeachments finished, then object the improper impeachments first.	Your objections are good, but there are too many of them. Some of them can just be dropped, specifically considered with the time. \r\nA minor point -- don't shake your head when other attorney is speaking. It seems weird for me. \r\n\r\nCross: \r\n- Your pocket is clear. \r\n- I like your tone.\r\n- You are a little aggressive during the cross. \r\n- Why do you need this impeachment? This is a minor point.	8	8	8	8	Lol your character is funny. I love the props. Your direct is really nice and you make all the answers very clear.	You didn't drop your character -- wonderful job.	Your tone is good. I like the line-up of the questions. Nice direct.	Your signpost is clear. Your questions are on-point and you have a nice control over the witness.	8	9	8	8	I love your character -- very energetic and lovable. You are a very nice witness and you have a lot of energy.	You handle this cross very well!! I'm impressed by "no accident" answer.	This is a really nice direct. The designs between each question are wonderful -- you two looks like have a chat instead memorizing from a script.	You have a really nice tone. The timeline is clear and you make your point very precise.	8	8	8	7	Bowman as an emotional witness -- this is a really interesting character. You have a really nice performance! Your emotion drags me into the story you create and you build the character well.	You still have your character! Nice! You handle the question well.	You match the witness's emotion well. This narrative is well -- she has no choice. I like the story you all created.	Don't object on relevance too early. Nice objection on 403. This hand is misleading and you make your points sweet and clear. \r\n\r\nCross: \r\n- Your points are clear! \r\n- Exhibit 5 is a good evidence \r\n- This cross is too long. Be aware of the time!!!	7	"When evidence connects, the truth reveals."\r\nYour job is to connect the dots and show out the full picture. You can have more tone variation and put everyone into your story. You are clearly reading. If you memorize the close, that would be better! The demo is good.	9	Nice energy. I like your posture very much. I like your structure. I like the "doesn't know" use of language. Refer back to other side's witness is good! Overall this is a really nice closing.	48	149	99	62	105	64	104	100	103	67	t
243	9	Theme: She turned off the lights, she hides all her lies\r\nReally strong opening narrative\r\nI really liked that you didn't use names until after the narrative, it really helped me focus on the story.\r\nStrong breakdown of witnesses\r\nExcellent Opening	8	I really loved that you established the facts that you agree with before told us what you disagreed with. \r\nTheme: Blinded by the need to blame.\r\nI really like the structure of your opening, it is a very well structured defense opening.\r\nThree questions to consider - good!!!\r\nI really wanted a team to say that the only reason that the state is charging bowman is because they couldn't get the main guy, so I like that part.	8	8	8	7	Believable character!\r\nOk, I think your hand motions are good, but at times they arn't really effective at emphasizing your points and are really only distracting. For future competitions, I would try practicing your hand motions to use them purposefully rather than every time you make a point!	Believable, good responses.	Interesting to see the map used. I really haven't seen this used, but I think it is effective in showing the witnesses passion and love for her park. Really lends to the believability of the witness.\r\nGood shift to ticketing system\r\nWell structured direct so far.\r\nYou are doing an excellent job at kinda fading into the background and letting your witness shine.\r\nI think you are moving a tad bit too much. Try to pick 3/4 points in your direct examination to shift your movement to cue the jury into when your direct is changing topics!\r\nYou have a really strong ability to shift topics! Even after the objection, you were able to seamlessly shift back into direct, well done!	Missed objection regarding the meaning behind the scream the night of the robbery.\r\n\r\nGood job getting a yes or no from the witness\r\nTry to shift your tone and make use of loud tone shifts and moments of silence to emphasis some of your best points.\r\nThis is a good cross, and if you apply some good tonal shift to it, it will be a fantastic cross.	9	8	8	8	i like the badge, cool costume haha\r\nthe awards are sick, I wonder what they actually are.\r\nYou are a very confident speaker, which lends a lot of credibility to your character\r\nThis is the best Kimball Demo I have seen. Excellent.\r\n"The Bracelet loophole" - ok so that answer was an example of a mock trial answer. You dropped a complex word and your attorney used it in the next question, to make it a little more natural, try to come up with a way in which the witness isn't having to lead you to your next question. Something like "well detective did you find any other issues with the theme park?" Answer: Yes we actually had a problem with the Bracelet Loophole" "why?" Something like that to make it a little shorter, snappier, and more natural.\r\n\r\nI probably wouldn't call the Defendant "suspect" it just sound kinda weird coming from an expert	I think the professional "cop demeanor" works well on direct, but with most characters you have to tone it down a little on cross so that you don't come off like you are fighting. \r\nYou are explaining a lot, but I think its smart to say "that was a yes" because it was obvious that you had already answered the question a few times when she asked them again.	Areas - Financial Crime Investigation.\r\nGreat job breaking down the direct into easy to understand material.\r\n"The Bracelet loophole" - ok so that answer was an example of a mock trial answer. You dropped a complex word and your attorney used it in the next question, to make it a little more natural, try to come up with a way in which the witness isn't having to lead you to your next question. Something like "well detective did you find any other issues with the theme park?" Answer: Yes we actually had a problem with the Bracelet Loophole" "why?" Something like that to make it a little shorter, snappier, and more natural.\r\n\r\nReally good job laying foundation for the hearsay objection after it was sustained.	Great objection to hearsay, really well argued.\r\nI liked the question regarding how the investigation was a favor not a full investigation\r\n\r\nGood job getting a yes or no on cross\r\n"You failed to put Cameron Pool under custody" - really strong question that looks bad on P	9	9	9	7	I like the the background for this witness\r\nVery like-able.\r\nI think cutting down on your answers is the one thing you can do to take this direct from a 9 to a 10. It will make the direct a tad bit more natural.	Good Job maintaining character on cross.	Your rhetoric is perfectly matched for direct and this witness. \r\nYour signposting was fantastic.\r\nI don't have a ton of comments for you guys, this was a really good direct, I think working on your movements and making them a little more purposeful is what can bring your direct style from a 9 to a 10	A lot of your objections, were really well placed, but it seemed like you got nervous and didn't argue them. Stick to your guns, you def could have convinced me to rule in your favor had you stuck to your points!\r\n\r\nTone variation is a really important aspect to cross examinations. You have a lot of really great questions, but they come off as the same level of importance as the rest. Use tone variation (ie. large jumps in volume or silent moments) to really emphasis the hard hitting questions in your cross.	7	6	8	9	Pretty strong emotion.\r\nI haven't really seen the emotion throughout the direct, I have really only seen it at the start. I don't know if it is coming back at the end, but it was really emotional at the start and then no emotion in the middle and end. Try to sprinkle it throughout to add some emphasis to the best part of your direct.	Ok it is a bit unusual for you to be like totally fine all of your direct except for the start, and then be really sad all cross. I think that if you sprinkle the sadness throughout the direct examination it will be a little more believable  when you are sad on cross.\r\n\r\nIt is not really believable for you to be fighting this much when you are \r\nsaid you were scared.	I liked the transition from the accusation to the story "Lets take a step back and understand how this happened"\r\nYour questions are framed really well. you put everything into the context of pool rather than bowman. you use his full name in almost every question. It leads no room for the jury to accidentally mix up names and think you are talking about bowman. it is very effective.\r\n\r\nBe prepared to handle small objections like leading, because they may seem  useless but it requires you to work on your feet and can be used really effectively to throw off the flow of a strong direct like this	This is a perfect example of tone variation on cross examination. You do an excellent job with using your voice and hand motions to emphasis important cross questions. \r\n\r\nMake sure not to cut off the witness.\r\nGood to get a yes or no\r\nGood job redirecting her to your question.\r\n\r\nGood job drawing the inconsistency between the two panels, I have never understood how people could mix up a lever and a button.\r\n\r\nGood redirect to answer your question with "feel free to discuss on redirect"	7	6	8	8	The notebook is a pretty good prop\r\nI am kinda confused by this character. \r\nI think this witness needs a demonstrative to help explain the numbers. They are a bookkeeper, bookkeepers are historically boring. So the moment judges hear that, they are going to be looking for an excuse to check out. Create a fun Demo just to map the investigation, not necessarily give a conclusion. \r\nI feel like the character did not fit the emotion that you were expressing talking about the robbery. Like this is a HUGE moment to get really emotional, and you didn't really do it.	I think this is a workable character, I just don't really get it. It seems like nerdy but I am a little confused what you are portraying.	Good job with signposting and letting the witness shine	Good cross pocket on bias.\r\nShort and sharp questions. Big fan of this type of cross content.\r\nQuestions come of a little awkward in the second half of your cross, but still effective.	7	7	6	7	Very like-able character, but do not understand the point of this witness	You are a very believable witness on cross. I did not really understand your direct, but your cross was super believable! Very Like-able performance!\r\n\r\nIn the later point of the cross, your believability decreases because you started fighting a lot more. You need to answer with a yes or no, you arn't really giving answers its more just like dodgy explanations	Ok I am really confused what this witness was used for.  \r\n\r\nMake sure you have combed through your direct for objections, because Opposing counsels objection really threw you.	Your hand motions and tone variation are really strong.\r\n\r\nOk I think you spent too much time on this bias cross pocket and it started damaging what was a pretty solid cross	9	Strong opening narrative\r\n"Like nothing had ever happened" - line gave me chills really really strong\r\nYour tone variation from the start of the close to the middle is excellent\r\nYour recollection of the defendant's testimony was really good.\r\nI really liked the headline for the journalist\r\n\r\nFantastic flip on their theme	8	Theme blinded by the need to blame\r\nI liked the lines where you said how many witnesses today said x, saw x, did x, - really strong for reasonable doubt.\r\n"Does this sound like a fair investigation to you" - good line	69	160	7	1	3	20	4	2	18	15	t
219	8	"Conceal, connect, complicit" = theme. I like how the opening is organized to match the theme, but I think you should change up the theme because it doesn't work as well as it could - especially the connect portion. The first part was definitely my favorite because of how well the story was told to appeal to my emotions - I felt the drama and importance of the circumstances. Presented VERY well! Great use of tone and pacing! I think you could probably use speed a bit more at certain times and practice movement a bit more. You addressed the theme four or five times during the opening, you should use it maximum three otherwise it's overkill.Plan out movement a bit more to feel more natural.	10	An amazing opening! I really loved the theme and the demonstratives that you used made it a lot easier to follow what you were saying. Your speaking voice is really just... great. Tone, pace, volume, you used it all which is ideal. Your hands had planned, but not unnatural movements and kept my attention. I loved the part where you discuss how if we're left with any questions at the end that's reasonable doubt. Done better than a lot of opening statements I see in collegial mock trial. My only note would probably to be just a bit closer to the screen so I can hear you a bit more clearly.	7	7	7	9	You had really good acting, but were lacking character and are missing out on an opportunity here. Be careful how much you elaborate in your responses. Some answers here triggered speculation objections in my head to I'd look over questions and be prepared for this. "fell on deaf ears" was a notable line. Good acting at the point where you talk about what happened that night.	Overall, you handled cross very well and showed the perfect amount of fighting in my opinion. But, at one point when you said "ya probably" you sounded defeated and it stood out - maintain your confidence!	Needs more scripted movement and ob Remember to put in the foundation that the wrist bands are a regularly conducted activity before admitting - hearsay. I tend to disagree that the fake bands were regularly conducted activity since they weren't made by the business so I'd be prepared with an alternative argument as well. I think you could be more responsive to your witness in terms of facial expressions and more structured movement. Your voice is good, but it is a bit stiff so these notes should help with that. Don't smile when your objection is sustained. Great use of case law in objection, make sure to maintain eye contact when responding.	Great objection responses and questions were very dependent on the witness's statements - showed a great ability to control the witness. You had a particularly unique hearsay objection, which I noted down you're able to argue and stick with your argument showed you were paying a lot of attention. Nice hearsay objection to the fake bracelets - I tend to agree that the fake bands were not a regularly conducted activity since they weren't made by the business and no evidence shows they were made by a business (a very big deal). Fix some of your transitions so that you can avoid saying "alright" or "ok" to a witness. There was also some hesitance when first starting out.	6	7	6	9	Said "uh" a lot. If you work on memorizing your answers so you feel more comfortable with the material, this should help a lot with saying "uh" and with any hesitation. I thought you came across as very confident and knowledgeable, which is exactly what you want in an expert.	You seem to do a lot better off notes because you're cross went a lot smoother than the direct.	Back up a little from screen. Your response to hearsay was good, but you were reading it - if you have your response prepared then make sure to have it memorized.  I loved that you said, "I stand by my objection" when you didn't have an argument rather than say nothing. However, you did it twice within a minute or two which started making me think you're doing what I call trigger objection (automatically objecting to trigger words without reasoning out if it's really objectionable). You should have a little list of statements that are and aren't hearsay to go by based on the specific case and witness.	Really good objections and responses. You take a step with every question, this is a form of rocking (which we do unconsciously when we're nervous, but can be distracting as a judge). Great response for hearsay. Once again, your tone and verbal pacing were great, your voice is very powerful without needing to be loud, but I'd like you to be a bit louder since your voice is powerful, but a little hard to hear.	7	8	7	10	Testimony was very clear and easy to follow, this is especially notable since this can be difficult with experts. I think you could come off as more credible if you fix your positioning so that you're sitting up straight	You looked like you were feeling more defeated towards the end of the direct, maintain your confidence!! Overall, great job! You were appropriately dramatic in the right places., but it's not coming off as very natural so I'd work on that a bit.	Your presence could be a lot more powerful on direct examination by utilizing more tone fluctuation in both objections and questions.	Your questions are very clear and consistent while maintaining a powerful voice and effective use of tone and responsiveness. I also liked that you're hand movements were intentional and didn't look oddly placed or forced. I noted that you took notes during the direct examination and I loved this because often attorneys don't do this, but when they do it shows you're paying attention and will follow up on things that came out during the direct examination. "Respectfully, that wasn't my question" done very effectively, controlled the witness without coming across as aggressive. Wait for witness to finish answer before moving into next question. The ultimate issue objection response - same to speculation, you didn't ask about the existence of intention. You asked about if any witnesses had testified about it which is not the same thing. Great responses to these objections.	7	8	8	6	Mr.Buttons was a nice touch. You had a lot of character here which I think really helped. You seemed like you were more in character when answering a question, but lost character a bit once the answer was done. The trauma isn't coming across very natural, I'd work on this. Slow down here, you seem like you're rushing a bit. You're witness is traumatized, give the answer more time to emphasis that trauama.	The little woman reference made me giggle. You maintained your character on cross which was great. You fought well by showing your character and elaborating when necessary. Similar notes to direct, but I thought you did do better here becuase you were a bit slower and your theatrics were more emphasized in a way that kept my attention.	Questions were very written out to be very responsive to what the witness was saying, which I appreciated.  However, your tone can be more responsive. Overall, I thought you came off as confident and I trusted you to give accurate information, which is exactly the sense you want to give to the judges. Great hearsay within hearsay response to police report and using state v Compton - the inner versus outer hearsay thing wasn't accurate as far as I know so stick with your gut there. If you need a moment to find something in a document, take it. None of us know every piece of material for this case and won't fault you for that.	You didn't have a lot of tone in your questioning which makes the questions pretty stiff. Great questions and confidence! Because you aren't varying your tone, it's coming across as very quick. Vary your pace as well and that should help exponentially, otherwise, it feels a bit like everything is coming very fast.	10	10	10	6	"I felt like a sea turtle, living in an ocean full of plastic." I'm definitely seeing some character without overdoing it. The giggles and smiles helped build your character a lot. I think you showed the most amount of character in a natural way through the trial without coming across as overtheatric. You were naturally responsive to questions in a way that didn't seem scripted. Very impressive.	I liked that you elaborated on your answers in a nonaggressive and logical way and then followed up with yes or no, this avoids nonresponsive objections and makes you likeable by both opposing counsel and judge's.	You did a great job at maintaining a strong presence in the direct examination without taking away from your witness. You gave ample time before asking another question to make sure your witness was done with her answer, great job. Don't think I would've done anything differently.	You seem to not be very comfortable with your material. You want to have a strong and knowledgeable presence, but you're coming across as more timid and unsure about what you're asking. I'd work on getting more comfortable with your material and I think it would help your presentation a lot.	10	9	9	7	Loved this character. Very similar notes as the first witness. Very natural, but provided a good amount of character without overkill. "I'm just this traffic cop, but for people" I loved this line.	You aren't fighting when unnecessary which makes a jury believe that you are here for the truth, not to disagree, which makes you more credible. Maintained confidence, nice. I think you could add a little more character to your responses.	Another great performance. Nothing much different from what I've already said. Don't nod. There's never really a trial moment where you should be nodding, a very minor note. Would've given a ten if there hadn't been as much nodding or smiling based on witness testimony or excessive stepping when asking a new question. Great objection responses and use of responsiveness towards your witnesses.	You come off across as confident and familiar with your material, but I think your presence can be stronger if you work on making your voice a little more powerful and don't end most questions with "right" or "correct," the witness will understand the question. I liked your hand movements during cross-examination and your tone variation. Also, don't use one word fillers after the witness answers (for example: "exactly" or "ok"). I wish I could give this exam a 7.5 because I do think that it deserves more than a 7, but I wouldn't quite give it an 8.	9	You voice seemed to have more power here than it did during the examinations which I loved! Make sure that your movements are controlled and purposeful. Great tone and pacing, you could vary volume a bit more for emphasis. You can be a bit more aggressive when storytelling - someone was put in a coma, it's a big deal.  "Is it reasonable....?" I liked this part of your closing a lot. You can use more pacing and emphasis here since they are big points. You appear to know when you should be slowing down and quieting for emphasis, you just need to do it a little more. Like your rebuttal that it's so unlikely for the opposing counsel's argument to work since it depends on so many unlikely situations if the defendant had no information or intention. Nice use of the officer deserving his life back after the defense's statement.	9	"No information, no involvement, no intention" really like this theme and the story telling at the beginning. You have a powerful voice and very confident, but I think you could use pacing and emphasis more. Similar to opposing councel, you seem to know where to be slower and faster and more dramatic, but you need to do it a little more to reach the emphasis you need. The tone variation is great, as stated my biggest issue is the lack of emphasis on important parts - especially "screaming and yelling" and "Ms.Bowman needs her life back... deserve her life back..." Pause between points to give jury time to process before moving on. Hand movements were intentional, liked use of demonstratives and how your structured your points. Nice reverse on opposing theme, although I don't think the connection part really worked. Nice job differentiating knowledge versus involvement.	53	169	84	88	89	14	85	91	17	90	t
280	9	I like your narrative, it was clear, and you deliver it really slowly. \r\nIt is better to separate the charges into different parts which will make more sense to the jury.\r\nYou need to explain the burden of proof and reasonable doubt in your opening.	8	I think your narrative about the opposing side is too long and not necessary.\r\nYou also need to talk about reasonable doubts more like what is reasonable doubt.\r\nYou do not need to mention what the other side will say.\r\nI think your narrative is a little bit too much.	9	8	9	9	You can add more characters in your direct.\r\nexcept for my first marriage, I like this joke.	You can add more energy and character in your cross answers.	I like your questions. It is very clear.	Good objection and change the ground.\r\nYou can add more prompts in your questions.\r\nI understand where are you going, it is better to make your questions more clear.	8	7	8	9	I like your custom.\r\nYou can add more characters in your direct.\r\nIt is clear that you are reading scripts.\r\nYou can use more demos in illustrating the financial problem.	You need to maintain your character on the cross.\r\nYou fight too much in your answers.	Pay attention to the judges' ruling.\r\nGood response to the hearsay objection.	Good objections for 702(c)(d).\r\nGood objections for lack of foundations.\r\nI understand your questions, but it was not clear sometimes.\r\nAnd you testify too much in your questions which make me confused sometimes.	9	9	10	9	I like your energy.\r\nYou can put more character into your answer.	You did a good job not fighting too much in cross.	The questions are really clear.\r\nGood use of case rules.	I like your questions, it is better to make them more concrete.	10	9	9	8	I like your energy and character.

You can be more regretful and remorse talking about touching the wrong button.	Good job for not fighting too much in your cross.\r\nVery clever answers in your cross.	Your questions are really clear.	I like your cross questions. They are really good.	9	I am confused about the gambling stuff, and how it is related to this case. Is it a metaphor?\r\nYour narrative is a little bit too long. It is better to incorporate them with the witness testimony.\r\nYou should talk about your charges,  burden of proof and reasonable doubt first in your closing.\r\nDon't say "your honor", say "members of the jury"\r\nI like your emotion.	9	I like how you talk about all reasonable doubts.\r\nYou explain the charges,  burden of proof and reasonable doubt clearly.	65	99	210	203	67	63	66	62	64	204	t

271	8	A sharp deadly knife, good hook. I like that every time you bring up the knife it is "deadly knife". We are hearing about 2 victims, I would like to hear a little more about each of them and why this case is so serious. This can also be a good chance to display some emotion too. Good job moving through the elements of the charge. Good job introducing witnesses.	7	It wasn't the defendant and it wasn't their knife, good start. Great job adressing burden and who holds it. I look forward to hearing these things you mentioned I hope they come up	8	6	9	7	Good tone and and natural delivery. Good job establishing early that this witness likes Whit Bowman so you aren't biased against them. I like where this is going getting ahead of the idea that no one could accidentally turn the ride on.	good tone early and good job correcting the opposing attourney in a respectful way. Good job answering confidently. Careful seeming fighty "it was similar to them but probably not them" this sounds bad after you agree it was 50% them	Phenomenal tone, you are sounding really inquisitive which is perfect for direct. Doing a good job letting the witness being the star and letting them do the talking. Good handling and entering of evidence. Doing a great job transitioning from one line of questioning to another. Once you are done with screensharing let the record reflect you are no longer screen sharing. I like pulling the trigger on that badgering objection right away, just to see what I would do. Careful interupting after I already made a ruling	Few missed objections on direct, listen carefully anyone saying something is "strange" or other opinions not rooted in facts. Good job adjusting after objection sustained. Good job getting the answer you want in a respectful way there when there was some confusion. \r\nGood job sticking your ground on the first hearsay objection. Good signposting. You can ask witness to answer in a yes or no but probably shouldn't repeat it three times. other types of control I like are "please limit your response to the question I asked"	9	7	7	8	Great energy on this witness early, hope it keeps up through direct and cross. Good job keeping in character while working through technical difficulties	might want to provide further explanation on the cutting corners question, this sounds pretty bad out of context. Good job keeping the energy up	Good job using the witnesses answer to begin the next question, flows very naturally. Good tone through direct. Way to keep your composure through technical difficulties.	potential hearsay objection during direct. Good tone asking serious questions in a firm but respectful tone. This was a tight cross that clearly moved through the important points, could have used a little more sign posting but overall strong	7	7	8	9	great adjustment to lay more foundation after I asked for it. especially in Zoom trial it is easy to read but be carefull about your reflection off your glasses	good unbiased casual answers. Great job not answering outside what you know, you don't know anything about how the ride runs and you don't need to help the defense. you clearly know your witness and understand where the defense is going with that question	good signposting, good handling evidence despite tech problems. I would tell your teamate to be careful about interupting the judge even during tech issues. Great adjustment when I gave you a hard time entering evidence	I like the objection but narrative is a difficult objection to get sustained. Good job impeaching, there is a procedure you can go through to actually pull up the affadavit and impeach but it doesn't appear that has been taught so good job. I love the way you are walking through this section on the risk te officer was taking in entering the tunnel. Careful asking that reaching question, you were in a great place with that line of questioning and were totally making your point, but you asked one question too far and the witness was able to say "I don't know anything about that" and end on a small win	7	6	9	8	I like how indignant you appear to be when asserting your innocence, doesn't always work but it does here. "longstreet is not stupid" this is fun delivery. Interesting, so you had a panic attack as soon as you saw the gun and reached up and accidentally turned on blackout mode? Really playing up the sympathy card with how hard your life is. So you can only afford 1 contact? This direct is very funny	Really confident in your response before that impeachment that you didn't give poole the idea to steal, be careful because that made you look shifty. Good job asking for clarification on an unclear question. Are your fingerprints on the bracelets? Have we heard this already or is this in evidence? On something like that I would answer "I don't know" unless it says it in your affadavit. In the defense opening the defense told us that it wasn't Bowmans knife, based on this cross it seems like Whit doesn't know where her knife is	Good casual tone, I like that you appear to be standing, it works with your personal style. "spill the beans", I like this. good handling of evidence and asking smooth questions about it but don't forget to enter it into evidence.	Good signpost to start. witness control not needed when the witness is just giving a little background information. I appreciate you actually going through impeachment procedure. You really have your stuff down the biggest thing is speaking with confidence. You seemed to gain confidence throughout this cross, started a little tenative.  Have we heard that her fingerprints are on the bracelet.	9	7	7	8	wannabe journalist, interesting character lets see if this holds through the direct.

192	6	You did a good job explaining the story of the case, and laying out what each witness will say. I liked your pacing, but you did end up going a little over time. You did a good job explaining the burden of proof you have, but be sure to outline what those charges are that you have to prove. You listed out the 3 charges, but the jury might not know what those elements are or what "Theft by Deception" means. \r\nGood repetition of stealing, thieving, and lying. It really painted a picture of a guilty defendant. Something extra you can do is emphasize each word whenever you repeat this phrase with cool voice inflection. This will help it stick in the jury's mind	8	Great job emphasizing how heavy the prosecution's burden is. I love how you broke down the elements to each of your witnesses and putting a lot of emotion into your opening. If you could simplify the law further to the elements, that would be *perfect*. I didn't catch a consistent theme in the opening, so if you have one, just make sure you emphasize it a bit more in your owning so the jury can remember it.	5	4	6	5	It was great that you were consistent with your tone on both direct and cross, but you have to remember that you want to be *likable* as a witness. A more likable witness means a more trustworthy witness which helps your credibility.  Staying things like "irresponsible jackass" makes you come across as angry, aggressive, and not likable to the jury. Please be careful of that.	Although your tone was the same as it was in both direct and cross, it came across as very aggressive. There would be times you would not even answer the question.  You did do a good job ensuring the other side did not get any evidence against you.	Good questions, but this direct could have been more engaging. It's hard over Zoom, but maybe using hand gestures or leaning into the camera more when the witness is talking, that could help. Another thing you can do is "loop" or "signpost" your questions to help the jury follow along (ex: "Now let's talk about the day of the incident")	The questions asked were not very clear or connected to each other. They seemed to jump around a lot and were different to follow.  The witness was very hostile, so you could have gotten away with being a little more aggressive to control the witness better. The impeachment could have been executed better. It was not clear what contradiction was being pointed out, if any.	10	10	9	8	Great accent! Great character! Great hand gestures! Your character was so believable and entertaining! I have literally no critiques to give you.	Stayed consistent during cross with the same accent and tone of voice you had during direct. I love how you stayed in character throughout and didn't lose credibility.	I loved the chemistry you and your witness had. The direct was very engaging! To take it to the next level, you could add in an exhibit or so :)\r\nThe questions you asked to clarify to the jury were important and well executed.	Great job with those objections! You kept your confidence up even when they were overruled.\r\nDuring cross, you have great attorney presence. Even though your character was very animated, you remained professional and even adjusted your questions based on the witness. \r\nYour voice inflection and pacing was good, but there were times I felt your questions jumped around a little when you went in between the different calls. \r\nTo avoid this, and make it more clear for the jury, you can "signpost" or "loop" your questions (ex: "Let's talk about when you were threatened with a knife)	7	8	6	9	You had a very good demeanor as a character during direct. I don't have any major critiques for your performance. It was just unfortunate that time cut your direct short.	Your character really came through during cross examination. Despite having your direct cut off in the middle, you still managed to keep your credibility and even added some extra testimony into your cross.	You had very good questions, but you ran out of time! To make sure this doesn't happen in future rounds, you can ask the foundation questions outlined in rule 702 and 703, that way, you don't have to go back and ask multiple questions that can take time. Good job using the hearsay exception under 703!!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the time limit really hurt your direct	Amazing job with objections! Your cross was very, very good!! The only thing I would say hurt your performance was the screen-sharing when there was some confusion as to who was in charge of sharing exhibits/affidavits. This is difficult to navigate with Zoom, but it would help if one of your teammate has the case already out and open and then you can just verbally announce which section you'd like to share. This comes with practice, but you did well overall!	9	10	10	8	Loved your character! I don't have any major critiques to give you.	Great job explaining away the deleted/"incriminating" text messages.  You kept your credibility intact and your character was consistent in both cross and direct.	This direct was a great way to start off the defense side! Very well done. Good job explaining things you knew the other side would bring up during cross. This let your witness explain facts in their own words before the other side twists it. \r\n\r\nGreat voice inflection! Your voice tone matched the witness' energy	I love how you pointed out each time the defendant lied. Your questions were very, very good! The only thing was that your witness would evade your question and you were not able to control her at times. To help with this, you can say stuff like that "I appreciate your response, but please answer my question." or "Redirecting you back to my question..." or "That was not what I was asking"	8	7	8	8	Your character was very engaging when telling the story on direct!	Even with the impeachment, you explained your mistake very well! Good job maintaining your credibility.	This direct was good, I would just lose interest from time to time. Keep in mind, this is the 5th witness the jury sees, so we're a little tired by this time, so try to be as engaging as possible to wake us up and have us pay attention!	Your passion and emotion was very good throughout the cross. Just make sure you loop your questions so it's easier for the jury to follow! There were some questions that gave the witness and opportunity to explain themselves, which ended up hurting you (ex: "would you say you have a bias?")	9	9	9	7	Your character was so cute I absolutely loved how credible and likable your character was.	Your character was fine during cross, but you became a little defensive with your responses and it made it seem like you were trying to hide something. You did a great job making sure the attorney didn't get any evidence against you during the cross.	Love the use of the demonstrative!!\r\nGreat use of objections	Great questions!! If you feel the witness being evasive or explaining themselves away, be a bit more controlling. You did a good job redirecting the witness back to your question when needed. Even with your technical difficulties, you kept your confidence up! You did end up running out of time, which was very unfortunate.	8	Your points were very good. I like how you broke down the elements the prosecution needed to prove. The only thing was that you were speaking *very* fast. Make sure you slow down!! I loved your passion and energy!!\r\n\r\nI didn't hear a consistent theme throughout the closing. I w	10	I love the use of the word "speculate" in your closing. I LOVED how you explained "reasonable doubt". This was an amazing closing. \r\nThe use of the demonstrative was very effective.	47	141	163	160	140	139	136	164	167	165	t
292	7	I like your intro story. it would be better if you can weave your witnesses in your story. don't be too argumentative in opening. always say " you'll hear that..." towards the end it seems you have forgotten your script. I recommend when memorizing the script, prioritize the start and end, because they make the strongest impression.	9	I like your intonation. slow and clear. introduce your witness a bit more. like who is Kaminsky. House of cards LOL is that from PPMT 2019?	8	8	7	8	I like your character, very natural. Be responsive to the ruling. the judge has told you to tell us the reasons before the conclusion.	it's very good you only explain on important questions. try to use the yes sandwich, yes, but.., but yes.	party opponent is non-hearsay, not hearsay exception. in cross, "she told you she wanted ... to pay the price". that's hearsay.	good witness control. I suggest you object hearsay to the Manuel. they might say it's all commands, not statements, though.	9	9	8	8	a confident policewoman. nice portrayal. very good that you're listening to the judge. maybe more frustration when you mention Thomas's death. opposing counsel is correct that you must include the facts and data you'll use later.	very good saying speculation yourself. very polished and prepared answerss.	very good that you're listening to the judge. argumentative is when the attorney is not asking questions.	I recommend you look up a case law called Tarot when arguing improper opinion. about 703, there's case law that says the expert can't be simply repeating the hearsay for its own sake.  Control her. tell her she can explain in re-direct. \r\n\r\nyour cross questions are not very refined. leaves a lot of space for the witness to fight. you can slow down more in cross. emphasize the important words.	8	8	7	6	I like your vibe. but I would like to see more emotions when you mention the robbery and the knife.	the answer length is appropriate. I like your brief explanations.	mental state more often applies to the declarant him/herself.	if it doesn't matter, don't object. the marks on the control panel don't hurt your case at all. only prosecution counsel has whit bowman opposing counsel. for the hearsay objection, a question is not a statement.	7	6	7	7	I like your clear structure. like the journalist costume. but please don't seem angry when the opposing counsel raises objections.	Be more confident in your answers. if the question is wrong, point it out. if it's right, just admit it.	"I've never seen him doing anything dishonest" is definitely character evidence.	I would say the testimony leans more toward reputation of improper character evidence. They are not very explicit that they're blaming this on Longstreet, but this is a very close call. well argued. \r\n"I've never seen him doing anything dishonest" is definitely character evidence. \r\nnever tell them it's your last question. then if the opposing side is smart they'll just start making troubles.	8	8	8	8	like your background. I know its really difficult when you keep getting cut off, but please try your best to keep your character. \r\nI'm so pleasantly surprised when you started crying. it was very genuine.	When you're asked about hitting the wrong button, it would be better to seem more regretful.	unavailability is the condition for 804. 804b6 means the prosecution caused poole's unavailability. non-hearsay scenarios include subsequent action, effect on listener, etc. you can go for non-character purposes. for example, the knowledge of Bowman that she gets rewards from Poole's wrongdoings.	When you argue 403, mention how you would weigh the probative and prejudicial values on a scale. here the probative value is actually very high. it explains her panic. Don't objection to every objectionable point. statements like "I'll be arrested" is really a consensus and unimportant to your case. very good confirming yes when witness says emmhmm. don't allow her to elaborate. tell her to do so in re-direct.	7	5	8	7	like your background very much. maybe you could add in more intonation. when you're talking about the conversation, which is really important to your case, draw people's attention to it by your turn.	you need to give Clear answers. I would recommend the yes sandwich: yes, but..., but yes. answers like maybe are unacceptable, but that's partly the attorney's fault as well.		"Longstreet is really lousy" is definitely improper character. xxx also told me that is hearsay. don't be afraid and shout out your objections :) that conversation is really full of hearsay you can object to. make sure you get a clear yes or no. maybe is no good.	8	I really like your intro, but when you get into legal elements, you suddenly speed up. do make sure you keep your tone slow and confident, and use pauses to signal important facts. I like your gestures very much. I'm not sure your team has a very clear theme. You may have included too much information in your rebuttal? overall it's excellent, but I usually recommend only mentioning 1-2 points in rebuttal to make them really memorable. having the last words is really a big advantage.	7	I like your calm style. Also please add more intonations so that it's more attention-grabbing. I like your structure, it's clear. saying "she did the right thing" still feels inappropriate because the outcome is tragic. she should be most regretful about what she did.	75	42	113	246	112	244	254	115	258	260	t
296	8	Maybe a bit more storytelling upfront. They don't really tell the judges what's happening in the case and Prosecution really has to give us the Who, What, When, Where, and Why. \r\nThe theme is okay, it doesn't super speak to me but it gets the point across.\r\nGotta watch time, you don't wanna be flagrantly over time or it's a bad look.\r\nReally, really strong presentation. Great inflection, wonderful delivery, very persuasive\r\nGreat body control	7	I like the three questions you ask, but I don't think you need to make them reliant on the prior answer saying yes. You never wanna admit you've even possibly done a crime. You could just ask the questions without the "even if he was" and they'd hit the same\r\nGreat inflection and presentation but be mindful of swaying. It takes away from your overall performance\r\nReally strong use of pauses and emphasis, overall powerful performance	6	7	8	8	Watch out for your eyes swaying back and forth. Generally, you wanna be off book for your performances, but if that's not a possibility, you wanna trick us into thinking that you are.\r\nThis character was fun at times, but I think at times it needed to be a bit more defined.	I think the character came out more on cross examination and I really enjoyed it! \r\nWait to work with the crossing attorney to not fight too much and take your moments, but occasionally you  sort of rambled off on answers you didn't need to. There are some questions your character doesn't have answers to and its okay to not have those answers occasionally.\r\nYou lost some character after the crossing attorney objected and you don't need to be too concerned about that. Keeping morale after objections shows us you're a truly phenomenal witness.	I love your energy dude. It is delightful to watch you ask questions.\r\nYou have a tendency to start your questions by going up with your voice. It works for you, but I think you could benefit from some variance. Explore some other vocal registers that you occasionally dip into. I think it could really evolve your performance\r\nMake sure to switch tone when you head to the crime itself. Its way more serious and your tone should reflect that.\r\nThat heresay to Prejudicial response was FIRE, great command of rules of evidence	Make sure to wait for witnesses to respond. We're online so it's not really your fault but make the adjustment to wait a bit longer to account for that.\r\nGreat questions! These are tough to answer for sure.\r\nGreat use of negative space.\r\nI think you can push further with your delivery. You have a great tone, but on cross, you really wanna emphasize the points that the jury should be extremely aware of.\r\nAbsolutely phenomenal objection responses. You're great with the law.\r\nMake sure to end on a strong note. The end should be the climax of the cross and you wanna leave us on the edge of our seats.\r\nGreat job!	10	9	9	8	I love this witness!\r\nGreat use of pauses, emphasis, and delivery. You do a great job taking your beats and moments and it was very clear what you were trying to tell us.\r\nI don't have a lot of notes for this direct, you ate.	Very strong responses, and good job brushing off some of those trickier points.\r\nYou lose some character on cross that I think you could keep up. It's there for the most part, but keeping that efficiency on cross is what makes the best witnesses. \r\nGood job not fighting too much because this was a genuinely tough cross.	You do a great job working with this witness! You have genuinely great chemistry. \r\nI think you can vary the delivery of your questions more. You have a very fun cadence, but I think it needs to go a bit further matching the flow that you and the witness have established.\r\nGreat understanding of law and composure during objections. Getting to that bias probative value got you out of a jam. \r\nGreat work!	You have phenomenal questions, but you don't need to end every question with "is that right" or "is that correct"\r\nThis is a TOUGH cross.\r\nVary your tone and delivery just a bit more. You can also slow down because you want to make these witnesses sit in these answers. You have questions that make them look kind of crazy, but I think you move through the questions a bit too quickly so we don't get to feel the full weight.\r\nStill, an absolutely phenomenal cross, I would not want to be on the other side of that.	7	6	8	9	This is a fun character but I think you should reign it in just a bit. It's very fun to watch you, but I think sometimes the amount of energy can be distracting.\r\nSome of your jokes come off as a bit scripted (The "dirty words" line comes to mind). If you're going to go for the joke, give it the appropriate time so that it can really hit.\r\nI think in general, you could slow down. A lot of your comedic beats are sped through and comedy is ALL about timing. Take your beats. Let your material breathe and trust it will be funny. \r\nOverall, you're very fun to watch and if you can really focus and distill that down, you will become an even more phenomenal witness.	You seem a bit flustered on cross. You're often (if not always) repeating the questions after the questions are asked and sometimes giving the attorneys more leeway to control you.\r\nSometimes you can just answer yes or no to the questions being asked because you're going to have to say yes or no eventually.\r\nRepeating the questions gets a bit overtop at some point. You should stop doing it because a lot of these questions do not call for it. I would suggest just taking a deep breath before answers.	Great leading of the witness through the material. You do a great job having a presence without being overbearing.\r\nTry to follow the delivery of your witness a bit more. Matching tone and energy, as well as focusing said energy is something the attorney can help greatly with.\r\nAs a point to that previous statement, you can vary your delivery even more\r\nGREAT use of redirect, particularly on the Cameron Poole identification point.	You have a great command of law. Your ability to argue these objections was very impressive.\r\nI generally enjoy your cadence on cross. I think there are some times when you ask a question where you can go on "the attack" so to speak. But your pacing is strong and your witness control is very impressive	8	7	9	9	You play this character very well, but I think you can build the character a bit more. It feels as though a lot of your actual personality is bleeding through which is good because it's pleasant. But I want to see more of Jackie Hunter and I want to see more how she differs from you.\r\nTowards the end of this direct, your character sort of feels like it changed and they were slightly less likeable. I would make sure to keep that characterization consistent.	Sometimes you are a bit too combative on this cross. There were times where I was able to see you were trying to think of how to contradict what the attorney said and it took me out of the performance. It's okay if they have some questions you have to say yes to, that's part of the game. Just prepare certain areas where you will definitely have a response and let everything else go.	You have a very delightful cadence on direct and you flow wonderfully with your witness.	You have a tendency to end your questions with "right" and you don't need to. Your cadence is already phenomenal. The questions speak for themselves and you have good questions.\r\nGreat pivoting and witness control.\r\nI LOVE your final pocket on this cross.	9	9	9	8	I can't tell if you prepared that bathroom bit but either way, pretty funny. \r\nI generally think this character can drop energy a bit because I get the feeling other judges will be overwhelmed by this, I'm usually pretty accepting of witnesses and this is even a bit much for me. Still, this is a funny witness and it gets points with me on that basis alone.\r\nYou can drop the bathroom bit after it's used initially. It only needs to be used as an initial set up to give us an understanding of the witness.\r\n"The state of midlands is like a heaven for functioning alchoholics" is an absolute bar and I love it.	Great job not fighting on cross examination. A lot of the questions are made to goad you into it, but you handled it well and stayed in character.\r\nThe "hmm, let me think" is killing me \r\nGreat job overall	You have a strong understanding of your material as shown in these objection responses. Very impressive.\r\nI like your direct cadence and how you sort of play more lowkey to match the more energetic Kaminsky. I think you can match energy juuuust a bit more. This guy is whacky. It's okay if the role you play as his attorney is also a bit thrown off by his energy.\r\nYou are awesome for this redirect.	This is a strong cross, but I think you need to slow down. There are some really crazy points and they aren't hitting to the fullest, only because your moving too quickly. \r\nThese are amazing questions!\r\nTake more time with those last questions. The end of the cross is when you have the time to really go in on the witness the most. Take advantage of that.\r\nStrong cross overall	8	6	7	9	There is a strong character here and you have fairly expertly come up with some explanations for some of these crazier points.\r\nI think you should craft this characters emotions a bit more. Emotionally understanding where the defendant is at is one of the most important things. It helps us to buy your explanations. Your emotionality isn't bad, but it could definitely be improved.\r\nI like that I can tell that you thought about this character. It adds to the performance.	Make sure to not get too defensive. The defendant has to walk a tight rope and you sometimes cross the line into argumentative or combatitive.\r\nI also lost a lot of the emotionality on cross. The responses were consistent, but they were a lot more point blank. Stay in your character.\r\nLet the attorney finish the question.\r\nGood job answering a lot of these questions directly. You never went into large paragraphs when that is a lot of defendant's natural instinct.\r\nWhen she was going for the impeachment, you want to get ahead of that or just agree. Getting impeached is never worth it.	You have a good cadence, but I think you can match your witness a bit more. Especially with the defendant, the attorney does a huge part in building the stakes. I think you need to match the intensity.\r\nImproper Impeachment is not the objection, it's a heresay objection to the document.	This cross is just strong out the gate.\r\nLove the cadence, love the questions\r\nGreat witness control! Particularly on this point about setting up the plan.\r\nThe impeachment was good for me. I think it could have been a little bit smoother but that just comes with experience.\r\nMake sure to make your final pocket hit harder. That's the note you leave us on and you really want it to stick!	9	I think you ought to directly address some of the main points the Defense made. They gave you a great venue to do it with those three questions, and I think you should attack them more. \r\nGreat job with the theme. I didn't like it up top but you convinced me.\r\nImagery would go a long way and explaining to us how your burden works with imagery and analogy would explain to us the legality and give us a better image of the whole thing.\r\nAn absolutely fire rebuttal. \r\nGreat closing overall.	8	I think you can be more intentional with your hand movements. You have a great cadence as always, but this draws me away from your performance ever so slightly.\r\nThe points about conspiracy are hot or miss for me. Some came across great in the trial, some I wasn't convinced of.\r\nWhen you get whipped into a fervor, it is extremely effective.\r\nAnalogies are your best friends. Explain to us how reasonable doubt works. Let us know with imagery.\r\nHonestly, you have great closing instincts, keep it up.	77	175	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t

202	8	- "She knew she planned and she lied"\r\n- great hand gestures/movement, especially on Zoom\r\n- I loved the storytelling you did a good job setting the scene and explaining the story which was especially helpful since I've never read this case before. I would say it could be a bit more concise especially in an opening statement. This feels more like a closing with how long the intro is.\r\n- Loved the burden demo very helpful, but the robbery part seemed a little odd to me? None of those bullet points had anything to do with the lines in the indictment? Maybe you need to differentiate between the "legal burden/definition" of robbery vs what robbery means in this particular case, bc it felt like you were conflating the two.\r\n- Overall your presentation was  incredible, I'd just find a way to maybe streamline the story . There were a lot of details that are hard to remember for someone who isn't as familiar with the case	8	- "" (so I missed the theme, but the fact that I only heard it once might be a problem as well lol)\r\n- So theory is Whitman accidentally hit the button on the ride? And that Cameron Poole was the real mastermind\r\n- Loved that you pointed out that the P side was trying to blame someone in the absence of the real culprit\r\n- I think you're description of the burden was better than P (which is really great for D) but I do think there was way too much on the screen at once.\r\n- I would try and vary hand gestures a bit more. You did a great job using hands the entire time, but I would've loved to see more variation and hand gestures that were a bit farther away from your body.	7	8	8	9	- Liked the talking with your hands it made it really easy to stay engaged with the testimony\r\n- Great job making important parts seem important through tone	- I would be careful on the fighting. Especially when you answer a question with "Yes....but ________" it makes it obvious you are fighting for your side.\r\n- Loved the rich and pretty line	- Liked the signpost placement, but I would find ways to mix them up a bit? Not just repeating the last 5 words the witness said but thinking of ways you can signpost in your own words\r\n- I would object to his cross question of "You don't think the state agrees with ____________" Speculation\r\n- You're argumentative was correct, good objection\r\n- the 403 was very messy. Confusing issues or prejudicial or misleading? Also does objecting to the gunshot thing help your case? Like does it matter? Think about not just if you can object but why you are objecting. If you make too many petty objections then it makes it less likely a judge will rule in your favor for the good ones.\r\n- same on the hearsay, just felt unnecesary	- I would've objected to her saying the experts conclusion that cameron poole was stealing money, Lack of foundation? or even an improper expert opinion\r\n- Good objection to "robbery", even if it wasn't sustained its important to point out\r\n- Loved your cross demeanor, you seemed very polite with a sad witness which was appropriate\r\n- I would not say "my client". Its a preference thing so I didn't mark you down, but it makes you seem biased instead of just reciting the facts. Very minor thought I loved the cross overall.\r\n- If someone objects to your question make sure to re-ask it and not just move on	8	8	9	8	- Great demeanor right off the bat very engaging\r\n- ...I would sound a little bit sadder mentioning your father being killed on the force but otherwise good intro lol\r\n- Well delivered DX but I would be careful with some of the conclusions that are made. Some of them seem like speculation or LoF and you were just lucky that no one objected	- Good job sounding non-biased especially on the bias questions. It makes the cross way less effective if your just sound honest	- Great signposts\r\n- I think Ms. Hu was incorrect on the 703. I don't believe there's anything saying you cannot enter a piece of hearsay for the purposes of her conclusion. I don't think you should've backed down.\r\n- Great objections to the impeachment I thought you were correct on all of them\r\n- The counsel testifying was  a bit pettier though. Its really important in Mock to think about when you are ahead during a part and to just stop objecting, especially if you have already made some good objections earlier.	- love your tie\r\n- love the offer to voir dire, but I think she's met 702A\r\n- I think I would've objected to Lack of foundation to the fact that cameroon poole was definitely involved? She can state that the tickets were in their locker, but Im not sure she can definitely say that Cameron had done it?\r\n- How does this witness know what blackout mode is? Isnt that a term that employees use? Isn't she just some random cop? LoF\r\n- Would've objected to "she lied to me" thats absolutely speculation. She can say that she changed her answer but there's no way anyone can say someone else is lying in court\r\n- Attacking the witnesses credibility is always important, but I'm not sure I would've impeached. Overall, I think a cop is qualified to talk about their investigations even if they worked in a slightly different type of investigations. \r\n- Ok also if she works in the robbery unit I think that's more than good enough for her to at least testify. Its kind of up for the jury to decide on if they think that's good enough at this point.	9	8	8	8	- in love with the accident\r\n- "what I do for a living...try to keep living" lol\r\n-	- I would be careful on the fighting. Especially when you answer a question with "Yes....but ________" it makes it obvious you are fighting for your side.	- in love with the joking with the witness and matching her energy\r\n- I would be more conservative with the argumentative objections. They have to be really obvious otherwise you kind of just seem obstructive	- On DX "...He thought that happened from time to time" that feels like hearsay for the truth?\r\n- I would make sure you are always asking close ended questions on cross. Not "Was there any screaming?" "Did you hear any gunshots". Instead use "You didnt hear any gunshot while at work." "You didn't see Whit bowman at the park did you?" Cut out the "Did you see _______?" completely. \r\n- I'd say slow down a bit more on cross overall. You sound nervous sometimes even though they are really good questions. Its making you stumble over your words as well.	9	9	8	9	- great enthusiastic tone, it was very engaging and easy to listen to you\r\n- "that's journalism 101" loved that line	- great job keeping up the character on cross\r\n- you were also not very fighty which always helps your credibility	- very minor, don't say 1. Ms. hunter can you introduce yourself? you just did it for her lol	- Great objection to LoPK. I would have maybe used speculation instead but close enough\r\n- Second one was also great I would have said LoF not LoPK but once again close enough.\r\n- Third one was great. Start with speculation though. Maybe even an improper expert opinion would be persuasive since we have no idea if she knows what is and isn't normal in the field of accounting or record keeping as a lay witness\r\n- I would not witness control without also reasking the question. For example, dont say "I only need a yes or no" and then ask a new question. It sounds like you are being petty/argumentative. Instead witness control and then re-ask the question so it seems like you are trying to clarify.\r\n- really great cross tone\r\n- I think you could benefit from a more casual tone with the witness sometimes. "You were never really good with numbers and math" you said it very serious and it kinda sounded mean. Especially with a really wholesome witness it can make you seem rude when you witness control or ask certain questions with a very aggressive tone. That's a very high level thing though and I loved the cross overall.\r\n- I'm not sure the asking her to do the math thing was necessary. It felt like you were overcomplicating a very obvious point	8	8	8	8	- love the outfit\r\n- great job on being engaging, but maybe slow down a bit sometimes, it was hard to remember important facts when you went through them so quickly	- I thought you did a good job not fighting. It really makes their points seem not important when you just don't fight for no reason.\r\n- sometimes you gave multiple answers per one question and it makes you seem nervous. "No. I mean I don't know because I wasn't there. But yes I think so"	- same comment I left for some of the other attorneys, but I would be careful on making the signposts sound more natural. Sometimes you have the witness say some ominous cliffhanger, and then you just repeat the last 5 words the witness said. A real signpost helps the jury better understand where the testimony is going not just repeats a point a witness has made	- good hearsay objection even though I overruled. \r\n- I wouldve reobjected to the excited utterance. She has to prove a lot for that to be an exception and Im not sure a voice over a phone could lay foundation proving that there acutally was a startling event	8	8	8	8	- great tone for someone under arrest	- great job pointing out the arrest report issue. Interested to see if you actually haven't read it	- I would take longer pauses after her answers sometimes? Especially very sad ones because it lets the drama sit for a bit. If you speed through it it takes away from the performance\r\n- would've objected to compound question on his CX to the fingerprints and guilt thing\r\n- if she's actually not familiar with the arrest report you should have objected for her much sooner	- I think there were quite a few LoF objections you could have made on DX. Bowman made a lot of statements about Poole's plan and didn't really explain how she knew that or why she believed that. \r\n- I would've objected 403 to her saying she "couldn't afford to get hurt by reporting him". Why would she believe Cameron was going to hurt her at all? It feels like she just said that to bias the jury with no foundation, and it didn't really add any probative value to the case.\r\n- "I left the mind eraser bc people kept throwing up" I think this would've been a really cool chance for you to be adaptive on cross. Ma'am you said you couldn't afford to lose your job no matter what? You have a family to support? Well you knew that switching rides was against company policy? You heard your boss say that earlier in trial? So you were willing to lose your job bc you were...scared of vomit?\r\n- slow down on CX, you were stumbling a bit and you cut her off a few times. Great hands and questions, and if you slow down it'll be perfect\r\n- I wouldn't interrupt the witness ever to be honest. Maybe if she was being wildly fighty, but it seemed like you were over controlling\r\n- for the hearsay I think she was correct. You can still point out a contradiction between what the detective says and what she says but I don't think she is recanting anything she's already said in court	8	- Slow down especially on the intro. You had a really well written start, that I think would have hit harder with some much longer pauses for dramatic effect\r\n- I love the emphasis on all of the defendant's lies, but it felt really focused on her lies regarding the ticket skimming and less on the robbery itself? I would've loved to see more of those text messages or something.\r\n- Great delivery and tone overall though. most of my complaints are kind of out of your control since your stuck with the facts that the case writers gave you\r\n- Great rebuttal I loved that you made a new demo really creative	9	- "Three, people two cashbooks, one accident" I wish I could have heard this theme a lot more often. I genuinely forgot about it until you said it at closings\r\n- The timeline has a lot more on it than what I remember. Make sure you all don't forget to update it throughout the trial otherwise it isn't as effective\r\n- Great emotion, hand gestures, and delivery on the important points	54	152	145	2	144	1	3	147	7	143	t
225	8	- the pain, the conspiracy, the truth - good opening\r\n- storytelling is clear and easy to follow\r\n- burden of proof and count element - clear instruction for the jury; a bit confused on the 'dangerous' part as this is not a legal	6	- don't start with charges and case law - imagine the jury being cavemen and -women: they don't know these legal terms and will get confused easily. Start with pathos and storytelling.\r\n\r\n- don't throw out facts out of no where - e.g. pressing the wrong button - what is the button, why is the button relevant, what happened before and after. The jury has never heard of the case before and all information remains new to them.	7	8	8	6	- practice the demo with your attorney more, instead of instructing them to scroll down.\r\n- the revenue exhibit - layout could be better. I can't see any number clearly on the screen.	- the opposing counsel was mostly asking open-ended questions, so you could have taken the chance to elaborate further (and consume their time)	- laying foundation for the employee manual = explaining relevance, why the witness is familiar with it. \r\n- dress code - even though this is just an online trial, still remember to suit up!\r\n- Good familiarity with ROE	- assuming facts not in evidence - spot on \r\n- show more confidence. Good that you have attempted to raising objections a few times, but be more confident, and also familiarise yourself from ROE so that you can prepare for the response.\r\n\r\n---- CROSS----\r\n- Why are you only asking open-ended questions? the witness could go on and on. Use a 陈述句 then correct/right/am I right?\r\n- The security up-to-date question - the opposing counsel objected relevance which has been overruled. You could have asked the question again to emphasise. Yet this is actually asked and answered and the P obviously missed it. You could have taken advantage of that.\r\n- familiarise yourself with improper character evidence - the witness' involvement in the taxation is exactly improper character. This is different to expert testimony.	6	5	6	8	- please do internet check prior to the trial\r\n- no character. couldn't catch any key info	- I understand that it may be super stressful for you when the internet goes off and that you have to keep on with the trial. Please try to test the connection properly before the trial :)\r\n- could have elaborated further instead of unconfidently says yes	- in response to the hearsay of Longstreet stressed we should never touched the button - could have just argued that it is used to show that the recipient has knowledge	- to that hearsay objection on 'Longstreet called me into the office and asked me whether I am familiar with the two waistband' - questions and commands do not have truth value\r\n- try to quote from the witness in full, instead of saying "the witness said xx wanted BALABALA" \r\n---CROSS---\r\n- you said Miss Billie - should be Miss Isaacs\r\n- really appreciate your patience when the witness experience internet issues. It may be stressful for you to catch key info from her when her internet goes on and off.	7	6	9	8	- your attorney should establish you as an expert instead of you establishing yourself.\r\n- should build an expert character that sounds more credible and professional. It sounds like you are reading out the script	- didn't remain the expert character (being credible etc) in the cross.	- solid foundation for expert witness. But establish the expert instead of having the witness say it.\r\n- good manner, confidence and familiarity with ROE. Could have rehearsed with your witness more.	- give the ground immediately after saying "objection your honour'.\r\n- good line of reasoning in the objection battle. \r\n- Good attempts to object. Most are reasonable but P's argument / judge's ruling were also valid. Don't feel demotivated just because an objection is overruled. \r\n----cross---\r\n- good control of the witness. \r\n-	9	8	7	6	- love the backdrop\r\n- Being the first character witness, you've left a strong impression	- good explanation following yes/no.	- 有一点太活泼啦 try to sound a bit more professional	- try to raise some objections to interrupt the witness's "show"	7	7	7	7	- not sure if it's script reciting or just a reporting tone for the journalist character \r\n- wonder who did the drawing	- don't be too nervous :) and avoid saying 'not sure' cuz that harms your credibility. If you don't understand the question, just ask the attorney to repeat in certainty.	- smooth transitions from one topic to another.	- try to break down some questions - some are too long and a bit ambiguous/compound	8	7	7	9	- interesting character in the beginning; sadly it was interrupted by the next lines of questioning.\r\n- consistent character + accent -	- lost the accent sometimes, but overall still have held the accent and character alright\r\n-  被p attorney带着跑了. She was a really strong attorney and you could have tried to defend your side(and essentially your innocence)	- the character building bit was supposed to fun - it's totally okay to let the witness establish her character for a bit. You are essentially self-objecting 'irrelevant' before the opposing counsel even raise it\r\n- good objection battle\r\n- don't like the bit when you say 'calm down, we are here to find justice for you' - like the witness wasn't even exaggerating anything, where does the 'calm down' come from\r\n\r\n---cross---\r\n-"are you honest in a way that benefits you" - could be more prejudical than probative or badgering the witness.\r\n- could have raised a few more objections to interrupt the opposing counsel's strong lines of reasoning.	- leading vs lack of foundation - fundamentally two different things\r\n- good objection battle\r\n---CROSS---\r\n- 气场🉑️\r\n- good control of the witness, and getting the answers that you wanted\r\n- i like your line of reasoning\r\n- the first impeachment, to my understanding, is a misunderstanding.\r\n- the last question is quite strong	7	- Nice that you followed three points your co-counsel mentioned in the opening. Good consistency\r\n- I understand that you understand the burden of proof but you didn't mention 'beyond reasonable doubts'. The three points (dangerous etc.) didn't fully rule out the other reasonable doubts.\r\n- liability is for civil case not criminal case.	7	- listen to P's closing instead of practising yours. Cuz you might need to rebut to points that he mentioned.\r\n- the structure is a bit messy - crossed out the counts on the slides, then giving some more explanations, then saying it's unfair to charge ABCD, then more explanation, then ruling out robbery 1 again - feels repetitive and not coherent. Could have give all reasoning under one argument, then go one by one, instead of going back and forth.\r\n- Could have quoted directly from what the witness has testified in today's trial, instead of simply following what you have prepared prior to the trial.\r\n- "there are too many reasonable doubts" - but just a few seconds ago you said 'it's just an accident, as single as that' - where are the other doubts?	67	105	93	184	92	188	193	187	98	191	t
270	8	It's a bit obvious that you're reading from the script - try look up a bit!\r\n\r\nGood speed and structure overall	6	Good energy out there - but try to tell the story before going into the details of the law\r\n\r\nI would prefer having the demo taken down for most of the statement - if you're not taking about the content on the demo, take it down!\r\n\r\nOpening is supposed to be introducing what the witnesses are going to say. Try use more phrasings like "You will soon hear that..." "MOJ, you will soon learn from the park owner J.C. Longstreet that ..."\r\n\r\nGood re-emphasizing on the theme at the start and the end	8	8	8	7	I like the logo on your t-shirt \r\n\r\nIt will be better if your attorney scrolls the slides for you instead of you telling them what to do\r\n\r\nGood keeping your cool after objection battles - also good tone & speed and your use of gesture!	Good response overall. Good keeping your cool throughout the cross	Good standing up as an attorney! Try enlarge your exhibit 6 a bit - it's really hard to see\r\n\r\nGood answer on \r\n\r\nI'd love see the control panel exhibit when you talk about it	Good catch on Assume Facts not in Evidence\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of foundations needed to be laid before an exception to hearsay to be use. Don't give up so easily!\r\n\r\nTry ask for limiting instruction when the opposing attorney responded "subsequent action" for your hearsay objection.\r\n\r\nI can see where you're going with the vip pass questions - but try to get closer to your point. You're trying to prove bias for Kimball.	7	7	6	7	I do want more character out of you! Billy Isaacs works at Chuggie's Bar and he's supposed to be fun! \r\n\r\nThis might be the internet issue but try to respond to your attorney - if you can't hear her, ask her to repeat. It's totally understandable to encounter technical issues on a zoom trial.		I can see your WeChat messages in your screen-share :)\r\n\r\nSpeculation - respond "it's based on her rational perception" and then keep on explaining!	Never say "thank you" to the judge no matter you are overruled or sustained!\r\n\r\nGood sign-posting at the beginning. Good use of sign-posting overall	8	7	8	7	You do sound like you're reading off a script - try vary your tone and speed a little bit. Good content overall		Good level of energy! Good response for objections. Try avoid asking "What happened next""Did you do anything" "did you find anything more suspicious"- you can use a better transition!\r\n\r\nGood response for objections overall\r\n\r\nMissed compound question	Only object 702 LOF when the witness testifies to her conclusion - entering an expert does not need all abcd from 702\r\n\r\nAgain, never thank the judge.	9	7	8	6	Love your level of energy! Is this zoom background deliberate hahahaha \r\n\r\nYou can sit back a bit - I can't see your forehead\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused though - how continuing blaming on Poole helps your case? Are you saying Poole is the sole person to blame?	You kinda lost your humorous character in your cross - try prepare a few jokes for possible cross questions next time	Good comforting your witness - it's like a mommy hoaxing her child	If you face a crying witness, try give some time for them to calm down before you move on to your cross examination - this can show your empathy\r\n\r\nI'm a bit lost at your cross. Where are you going at here?	7	7	7	8	This is cute - painting a man in the background (although I'm not sure if actual witness would do that in the real trial) - but why is it here?\r\n\r\nYou do sound a bit like reading off the script - good tone variation but you can shift your speed a bit\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't really see how you help your side's case			missed objection to bowman's character evidence\r\n\r\nGood line of questioning for cross. Although I would prefer shorter questions (also it's just easier for the witness to comprehend)\r\n\r\nGood control of witness	7	6	6	8	Good to have a character! Although I don't see how your Indian accent help boost your credibility - we're doing character either to be humorous or boost our own credibility, instead of for the character's own sake.\r\n\r\nI think it's good to have accent but never let your accent to influence the clarity of your statements. - okay, now it's a Pakistani accent	I felt like your accent lost a bit in cross?\r\n\r\nLet your attorney object to hearsay if you think that's an improper opinion	I personally would never disrupt my own witness - if that's a joke that you're trying to make, maybe try to avoid interrupting or saying "calm down" to your witness.\r\n\r\nAgain, never "calm down" your witness\r\n\r\nMissed council is testifying - you objected at the wrong time	Good objections overall\r\n\r\nWhen you have to repeat your question, try vary your phrasing - Being honest is important, right? = It's important not to lie, right? Same thing when you threatens to impeach the witness\r\n\r\n"You're honest in the way that benefits you?"\r\nThis come out a bit vague - they objected, but on the wrong ground\r\n\r\nTry slow down a bit - it's hard to catch what you said \r\n\r\nGood line of questioning - I really like short questions in cross\r\n\r\nGood control of your witness - although you don't have to threaten for impeachment too much - don't overuse "is it your sworn testimony that xxx"\r\n\r\nDon't give the witness the chance to explain for herself in impeachment - just read the line and go on - check out the impeachment procedure\r\n\r\nDon't let the witness direct you \r\n\r\nAgain, never show your screen with WeChat messages\r\n\r\nThe fact that you have almost 20 minutes left doesn't mean that you need to use them all up	8	Good referring back to your theme\r\n\r\ndeliberate, dangerous, thoughtful\r\n\r\nGood summarizing the case\r\n\r\nYou can pull up some demos in closing	7	I am not a fan of a demo with A LOT of words \r\n\r\nI think instead of talking too much on bowman's "shiny honesty", you can try rely more on other's witness' corroborating testimony\r\n\r\ncoincidence is never intention - theme\r\n\r\nIf something is mentioned in the affidavit but not in the trial, do not bring them up in the closing\r\n\r\nThe structure of these closing is a bit messy - try reorganize it, you have good content\r\n\r\nInstead of being very excited throughout the speech, try vary your tone a bit	67	173	92	93	188	184	193	98	96	191	t
184	7	Sorry I missed it, what was the theme?\r\n\r\nHow that change of tickets are relevant to a case of robbery.  Jury cannot see the relevance immediately.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to preempt for the defense's strategy in this case, it's not a closing argument.\r\n\r\nLike the explanation of the counts, but you can go a bit further to interpret them as points that can be connected to the testimonies that you are going to introduce afterwards. Like the questions raised at the end tho.\r\n\r\nYour burden is to prove *beyond a reasonable doubt* not *by reasonable doubts*.	7	There are better ways to put everything on Poole. You can point to the missed connections the prosecution would fail to prove.\r\n\r\nDon't let others know you are making a mistake. If you don't stop, no many would catch it.\r\n\r\nYou should break down the counts and point to specific elements and connect them to the testimonies. So that you can argue confidently what the prosecution would fail to prove. \r\n\r\nI don't quite get the theme, that friendship thing.	7	8	7	6	I don't quite follow some of the transitions. For example, how Poole would suddenly threat you with force when he was taking money secretively before.	You can vary your answers a bit and be more proactive on cross.\r\n\r\nGood familiarity with your materials.	Signposting necessary. We need to see the relevance before the answer comes out.\r\n\r\nThat 'did you see anything weird' question was somewhat suggestive. Same for that question with very specific time.\r\n\r\nYou need some kind of variations of tones to draw attention to the specific parts of the testimony. Also I failed to figure out how this is connected to the defedant.\r\n\r\nCalls for speculation missed.	Good control of the witness.\r\n\r\nThe questions are concise and short, liked that.\r\n\r\nSome signposting, great. But you also need to adapt to the contents in the direct examination. I think that the scheme of stealing before the robbery was something discussed already in the direct examination. You should engage more with the direct examination.\r\n\r\nMake your questions land. Everything was about Poole and not Bowman. You can also blow the questions about the knife up in a better way.\r\n\r\nDon't ask open-ended questions. \r\n\r\nDon't interupt your witness.	7	7	7	8	You'd be better off without the sunglasses.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to argue 2 years would constitute a trend. But the explanation is professional.\r\n\r\nThe narrative was too fast when describing the incidents.	Like the answer, but you probably shouldn't be smiling for your father's death.\r\n\r\nBtw, I can see you texting.\r\n\r\nThe last several questions could be argued/fought.	That record, you did not lay enought foundation for 803(6). You need to go back and see what are the requirements there. And you actually don't need that to be admitted if an expert is testifying. See 703.\r\n\r\nRelevance objection has a low bar.	Nice hearsay objection, good try.\r\n\r\nSome questions are bit long. You will find it hard to control the witness because of that.\r\n\r\nGood signposting!\r\n\r\nProof of offer for relevance objection argument.\r\n\r\nThe structure was a bit weird. All the bias questions should be grouped together.	7	7	6	6		Some of the answers regarding the benefits questions were too 资本家 like.\r\n\r\nNice picking of the fights.\r\n\r\nYou could fight the last question.	How is this comments issue relevant?\r\n\r\nI don't quite see how this witness helps to explain any of the elements in the trial today.\r\n\r\nThe last question, LoF for sure. You should object to it.	The 'standard revenue' is objectionable I think. Not for this business, and there would be questions about its credibility.\r\n\r\nHow are these benefits/tax evasion/facility spending thing relevant?\r\n\r\nLet your questions land. Need signposting.	6	5	7	7	Good preempting the shift of work questions.\r\n\r\n'I didn't see this myself' that's just lack of foundation there.\r\n\r\n'Everybody likes' that's speculation.	You don't need to be that combative on the cross. The attitudes and manners were just so different. YOU SIMPLY DON'T DO THAT.	The questions about 'theft by deception' were way too 'suggestive'. You could break it down by asking about specific actions of help one by one.\r\n\r\nBoth of you should look again at the definition of hearsay.\r\n\r\nGood signposting, but you are testifying a bit. And the transitions were too quick and too frequent.	The improper opinion objection is good. But a better ground would be lack of foundation. The witness lacks the foundation to answer it.\r\n\r\nBoth of you should look again at the definition of hearsay.\r\n\r\nGood hearsay objection on the text messages. Missed some other objections.\r\n\r\nGood controling the witness. But some questions too long, and that's why you would find it hard to control the witness on that.\r\n\r\nKeep your own pace in the cross. Btw, don't comment 'amazing'.\r\n\r\nMake your questions land.	7	6	7	6	Like the efforts of portraying an character. You need variations to catch the attention of the jury.	You SIMPLY DON'T FIGHT EVERY QUESTION.	Don't LEAD.\r\n\r\nThe narratives need improvement. You should introduce to the members of the jury in an ordered way, so that you can show them what is the point you are proving.\r\n\r\nIn fact, how is this relevant, the weird things about longstreet and haley. Also the facility questions?\r\n\r\nThose character evidence was not allowed. You didn't note those on the captain's meeting form.	Lack of foundation. How did the witness know it was Longstreet.\r\n\r\nImproper character evidence.\r\n\r\nMake sure to let the jury know where you are heading.\r\n\r\nThe bias pocket did not land.	8	9	7	7	Good energy. Good story telling and explanation.	Didn't break the fourth wall. That's good.\r\n\r\nWisely picking the fights.	Improper character evidence.\r\n\r\nThat hearsay objection falls better under 'then-exisiting state of mind'.	'Too cheap to fix'. that goes to an improper speculation on the reason why Longstreet made the decision. THAT foundation is lacking.\r\n\r\nNice shift to hearsay objection. But foundation is still lacking here.\r\n\r\nI didn't see some of the questions were going. As if you were actually the defense.\r\n\r\nAgain, questions are too long	6	Where's the harm on Haley.\r\n\r\nThis is a criminal case, it's beyond a reasonable doubt, it's not proponderance of evidence.\r\n\r\n'He knew how dangerous it was '. This goes to intention. Make this clear. Similarly for all other elements.\r\n\r\nI never got the theme, make it clear.	7	If you are trying to argue that Cameron Poole did it all. Then how is your cross on the stuffs by Longstreet matter? And what about Haley?\r\n\r\nThe theme is not clear. You need to make it short, concise, and powerful.\r\n\r\nLike the questions.	60	101	252	27	34	251	254	29	32	33	t

Calm down emotions instead of getting more irritated. Makes the witness look bad when you get upset.	-This witness has such a robust character! To match that energy you can vary your voice tone and volume; Act interested in what the witness is saying, bounce off of her energy. \r\n-Good knowledge of hearsay rules. You explained the 803(6) exception for exhibit 7 very well. \r\n-Nice job responding subsequent actions to hearsay objection on Longstreets statements. \r\n-When Floyd talks about the knife and being threatened, match her emotions. Really sound like you are sorry for what she went through. \r\n-You know your questions and content so well! To improve, I would suggest working on how you perform your direct. Add more energy when you ask questions. Try to avoid sounding monotone and falling into specific voice patterns. Match your witnesses emotions and energy.\r\n- Try not to make objections like argumentative unless it is egregious. \r\n-Good redirect question to rehabilitate witness credibility after impeachment.  \r\n-Your demeanor and confidence during objection arguments is great!\r\n-Redirect is supposed to be very short and only one or two questions. This redirect lasted a little too long.	-Great objection on the demonstrative! Nice job catching that they didn't admit exhibit 7 into evidence. \r\n-Great job speaking with confidence when objecting and responding to opposing counsel's argument. \r\n-Do not motion to strike the witness's statement before the objection is sustained. \r\n- I like your tone on this cross, isn't too aggressive, but still firm and pointing out the dishonesty of the witness. \r\n-Great job catching the witness's contradiction. Good impeachment. \r\n-Nice job keeping calm composure when witness gets emotional. \r\n-Great job with witness control, "is that a yes to my question"\r\n-Really great job feeling sympathetic to witness about knife threat. \r\n-Be careful not to interrupt witness. \r\n-Great speculation objection during redirect.	6	5	7	8	- Good character. Very believable and real. \r\n-Try to avoid using notes! You sounded like you were reading throughout your direct. Instead, add more character!\r\n-Was talking too fast.	-Good responses on cross about injuries at the park; you were very nonchalant when answering about whether your park has injuries, which was great because it made it sound like injuries are inevitable and happen at all amusement parks. \r\n-could add more character on cross. \r\n-be careful with responses and risking impeachments. \r\n-be more confident in your answers! You sounded unsure when answering some of the questions. \r\n-Try not to be too fidgety during cross, it makes you look less confident and sure of your answers.	-I really like your demeanor on this direct! \r\n-Good job looping witnesses answer into next question.\r\n-Be careful about the speculation. The witness cannot testify as to why they think there was a change in Bowman. This enters into the mindset of Bowman. \r\n-Since the witness heard that the revenue was decreasing from another person, this qualifies as hearsay, so just because the witness is knowledgable of this, it doesn't mean it's not hearsay. Subsequent actions is the right response for this objection, which you did get to!\r\n-I like that you are signposting your direct by saying what you are going to ask about. \r\n-Good redirect on tax evasion. Try to keep redirect short though. Over two or three questions is too long for redirect. \r\n-Great improper character evidence objection on tax evasion!	-Great job with speculation objection on "sudden change with Bowman." That is absolutely speculation. \r\n-Really good job with asking for limiting action on hearsay statement for subsequent actions. \r\n-Good command of rules of evidence, especially hearsay rules! \r\n-Be careful to not interrupt the witness \r\n-Good witness control, "is that a yes to my question"\r\n-Good looping on cross; "you tried to help them, but..."\r\n-Nice job responding to improper character evidence with motive and intent. You know the rules of evidence very well. \r\n-Nice cross demeanor and speaking volume. \r\n-You interrupted the witness multiple times, try to avoid doing that.	7	7	7	8	- I love your character for the detective! Very professional but still has fun character.\r\n-Spoke too fast, could slow down. \r\n-Answer at the end was too long, lapsed into narrative.	- Good job knowing your affidavit and supplemental report during impeachment/voir dire. You pointed out exactly where it says you worked in the robbery unit which was great.\r\n-Good response when opposing counsel was trying to point out your bias. \r\n-Need to sound more confident in answers.	-Great demeanor for direct!\r\n-Good response to the impeachment/voir dire. \r\n-You can vary your voice tone more during the direct! try not to sound monotone. Instead, vary your voice patterns so that you capture the jury's attention better.	-You did a good job conducting the voir dire but it went bad when the witness pointed out in her supplemental report that she worked in the robbery unit. Make sure before you impeach that the witness is actually contradictory to her affidavit or supplementary report. Your objection did show that you are knowledgable on rule 702. \r\n-Good improper opinion objection to Bowman lying. \r\n-Very confident during objection arguments.\r\n-Good tone on cross, I like to volume and tone variation. \r\n-You pointed out the witness's bias very well.\r\n-Nice job with witness control\r\n-You did a good job pointing out the detective's lack of investigation and evidence. \r\n-Be careful to not interrupt witness.	9	9	8	8	- Such a fun character!\r\n-I like that you took time to look at the exhibit when your attorney asked if you recognize the picture. \r\n-could speak a little slower.	-Nice job keeping character throughout cross!	-Good direct demeanor, but could vary voice tone more to match energy of witness. \r\n-Good response to hearsay objection; not for the truth since it's a question. \r\n-Try not to speak too fast and ramble during objection arguments. Speak slowly ad confidently. \r\n-Protect your witness when the opposing counsel interrupts them. Object to badgering the witness or introduce a point of order to the judge if opposing counsel interrupts more than once.	-Very good objection to the verbal assertions on exhibit 11b. \r\n-Good speculation objection to Longstreet being worried. \r\n-Do not speak during an objection argument unless the judge asks you to. You can ask the judge "may I respond." But do not speak unless the judge allows you to. \r\n-Good job arguing lack of foundation for Isaacs knowing cameron poole. \r\n-Do not interrupt the witness when they are answering. \r\n-Try not to sound monotone when asking questions. vary tone more. \r\n-Be careful not to misgender witnesses.	10	10	8	9	- I like the pace you are speaking at. You didn't speak too fast or too slow. It was very easy to understand you. \r\n-Love your voice tone variation. \r\n-You do a really good job explaining the control panels to the jury so that they understand it really well. \r\n-Great character, and implementing the fact that you are a journalist, throughout testimony.	-Nice job staying confident throughout cross. \r\n-You kept your character throughout cross which is really good.	- Good demeanor but can vary voice tone. try not to speak in monotone. \r\n-The demonstrative for this witness was very effective. \r\n-Be careful when objecting relevance. Remember that bar for relevance is very low, and bias is always relevant.	-Good cross demeanor \r\n-You did a good job pointing out bias of witness. \r\n-Great job responding to the relevance objection with bias.\r\n-Great line of questioning about the witness sneaking into office trailer.	9	10	9	8	-Good volume and tone variation\r\n-Love your character! I like that you get upset that you were put in jail for 2 years.  It makes you seem human.\r\n-I like how you explained the ticket scheme and your involvement.\r\n-I like the emotion and fear you portrayed when you talked about the tunnel of terror incident.   \r\n-Try not be too emotional and loud all the time throughout your direct. Get soft at some points to show your fear and sadness.	-kept character and confidence throughout cross; very good	-I like your tone fluctuation. You sound interested in what your witness has to say. \r\n-Good hearsay objection to the text messages and nice job explaining that cameron's statements are not part of the party opponent exception.	-nice job looping witness's answers into your next question. \r\n-good hearsay response to Bowman's statements, party opponent exception. \r\n-good line of questioning on Bowman's familiarity with the tunnel of terror control panel.	7	-Good job saying theme at beginning of closing. \r\n-Slow down at the beginning, emphasize your theme more. \r\n-Switch up pace and tone of voice throughout closing to emphasize certain points. \r\n-nice job going through burden and the points you have proved. \r\n-demonstrative for charges was effective. \r\n-good responsiveness to defense theory. \r\n-I like how you went through what constitutes reasonable doubt. \r\n-Good job responding to defense witnesses and pointing out biases. \r\n-Talk more about the evidence you brought to court instead of only responding to defense. You have the burden in this case so you need to highlight the evidence that you brought. \r\n-Spoke too fast throughout closing.\r\n-closing needs to have clearer roadmap so the jury knows what you are going to talk about. \r\n-Theme needs to be more present throughout closing.\r\n-No rebuttal?? Prosecution always has rebuttal and you should always do rebuttal as prosecution.	9	-Nice job saying theme at the beginning. \r\n-Love the tone fluctuation, emphasis, and pausing. \r\n-Good speed, not too fast. \r\n-went through prosecution's burden well. \r\n-Like your explanation of reasonable doubt. \r\n-Good signposting throughout closing, had a clear roadmap for what you were going to talk about. \r\n-great hand gestures\r\n-good repetition of theme throughout closing. \r\n- "let me examine these one by one"; very good. \r\n-nice job being responsive to prosecution and talking about what happened in trial. Shows you were listening and paying attention throughout the entire trial. \r\n-You did a good job explaining Bowman's situation and humanizing her. \r\n-Great job responding to prosecution's theme.	55	132	12	13	11	212	10	8	9	216	t

161	7	Notes: \r\n- Theme: Evade, deception, property. \r\n- Narrative: checked\r\n- Criminal charge: robbery I & theft by deception\r\n- Criminal elements: Three facts, unable to note all of them down. \r\n- Burden of proof: beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n- Intro to witnesses: checked\r\n\r\nComments: \r\n- Slow down, too fast. More emotion when retelling the story. \r\n- I hear your three criminal elements. However, I suggest you state a summary of them first and then explain each of them. At this point, I cannot note every single criminal element clearly. \r\n- I think you can also consider using a demonstrative (PowerPoint) in the opening statement. You can write some important words/concepts in the slide show. \r\n- You need to define what is a "reasonable doubt" and what is "beyond a reasonable doubt."	7	Notes: \r\n- Theme: She was terrified, she tried, but she made a mistake. \r\n- Narrative: checked\r\n- Criminal charge: \r\n- Burden of proof: raise reasonable doubt - checked\r\n- Two facts: no motive / invested in an unfair way\r\n- Intro to witnesses: checked\r\n\r\nComments: \r\n- The speed is good. But you need to add more emotion when retelling the story. \r\n- Good intention to use hand gestures. However, I cannot see them clearly. \r\n- As the opposing party has not defined reasonable doubt, you need to define what is "reasonable doubts" in your opening statement. \r\n- I think you can also consider using a demonstrative (PowerPoint) in the opening statement. You can write some important words/concepts in the slide show. \r\n- Do not intend to ask questions to members of the jury or let members of the jury imagine some scenarios.	7	6	7	7	I don't see a clear/strong character from you. I understand that you are trying to build a professional character, but I think adding more funny characters will make your character more likable. For example, you are crazy about math. Why not add more math jokes to enhance your character? \r\n\r\nAdd more pauses in your answers. It seems that you are reading your script, and I suggest you not have a script on your screen.	I think you can try to explain more in your responses instead of just saying "yes."\r\n\r\nIf you choose to have a character in your direct, remember to have it maintained in your cross.	Add more transition words to your scripts. You need to make the structure of your direct very clear. \r\n\r\nI think the cooperation between you and your witness is relatively good, but you need to make the flow of the direct more natural. \r\n\r\nObjection: \r\n- Hearsay: "Cameron said ...."	Your team wants to prove two things: Bowman has no motive, and Bowman faced an unfair investigation. I am not sure how tackling Cameron's credibility is helpful to achieving your team's case theory.\r\n\r\nI think you need to add more transition words to your scripts. You need to make the structure of the cross-examination very clear.	6	6	5	7	I don't think your character is natural enough. You can imagine what will a policeman who received years of training will speak in court. You could say "Yes, sir" or "Yes, ma'am"\r\n\r\nCan a detective have bad eyesight? \r\n\r\nI think the objection battles limit your performance.	In cross-examination, it is suggested for the attorney to ask close-ended questions, but the attorney can ask you open-ended questions.\r\n\r\nGood explanations on Exhibit 5.	Objection: \r\n- Only talk to the judge in an objection battle. \r\n- Exhibit 11: are you using it to offer for the truth matter asserted? ("the truth matter asserted" means you want to use the words of the )\r\n - Not everything included in the care package is in court. Statements made in court are those testimonies made by previous witnesses. However, the "Billie Isaacs" statement is a statement made out of court. To prove it's not hearsay, check Rule 801 and Rule 803\r\n\r\nNever say "Thank you" to your honor. Just "Yes, your honor." is enough. \r\n\r\nI don't think the witness technically knows the number of the exhibit. Hence, asking if your witness is familiar with exhibit 11 is not professional. You need to describe.\r\n\r\nDue to objection battles, I think many contents (that are originally in your script) were omitted. You need to get more familiar with the Rules of Evidence. \r\n\r\nAdd more transitions to your script to make the structure of your script clear and how it helps to achieve your party's burden of proof.	Objection:\r\n- Hearsay: "stop him"\r\n- Hearsay: Exhibit 11\r\n- Hearsay: Billie Issacs statement\r\n\r\nGood objections. To improve your performance in your objection battle, you can refer to the definition of Hearsay. \r\n\r\nI don't think asking the detective to "show how Exhibit 5 is related to theft by deception" is a good idea.  Giving more freedom to the witness to answer your questions indirectly reflects your poor ability to control your witness. You don't have to let him explain the conclusion. \r\n\r\nControl your witness more. Your witness is not responding to your questions.\r\n\r\nGood content coverage, but I think you need to add more transitions or pauses to make the structure of your script clearer.	7	7	7	9	I like the way your dress yourself up! I think your tone can have more changes. You need to make the way to speak compliant with the way you look like. \r\n\r\nI think you can make the flow of your speaking more natural -  you seem to be reading from a script. You can also lower your camera a little bit, so we can see your hand gestures if any. \r\n\r\nGood rephrasing when your responses are objected to on the ground of speculation. \r\n\r\nBe aware of the pronouns.	I like the way you respond to cross-questions. \r\n\r\nYou can add more explanations in your responses. I think you have attempted to do so, but you can add more explanations.	Objection:\r\n- Lack of foundation: when arguing,  provide a summary of what the witness has said (what foundations have been provided), and then explain how that is sufficient for the witness to make the conclusion. \r\n- Speculation: When your witness is saying, "Cameron is angry," your witness needs to provide sufficient evidence to support her argument. - Rational perception. \r\n\r\nTry to rephrase and revise your script and avoid superficial objections such as lack of foundation. \r\n\r\nBe aware of the pronouns.	Objection: \r\n- Lack of foundation: good arguments. But I think you need to make timely objections. \r\n- Speculation: Good objection. \r\n\r\nGood hand gestures. \r\n\r\nGood reminder on pronouns, but I think you can have more professional ways to make that reminder - such as in cross, or let Bowman herself clarify in her direct (she is the party presentative who is present at the counsel table throughout the trial). \r\n\r\nI like the way you conduct your cross. You have changes in tone. You use hand gestures. You make the structure of your cross-examination very clear. Very good control of your witness. \r\n\r\nYou do not have to explain why you are asking a question in the cross-examination. That could be objected to on the ground of "counsel is testifying."	10	10	8	7	I like your character!!!! Typical Chinese family, nerdy person, but like to play. \r\n\r\nI like how to put your glasses on when looking at the exhibits. Those details are really good. I think you enjoy performing this witness.\r\n\r\nI like those jokes you integrated into your answers. Those not only maintain your character but also make you sound more reliable. I like the "催婚 (urging marriage, not sure if Chinese characters will be saved properly in this platform)" part.	Good facial expressions, body language, and hand gestures.\r\n\r\nGood use of “赠人玫瑰，手留余香 (help people, help yourself)” LOL\r\n\r\nGood balance between short, firm answers and long explanations. \r\n\r\nYou are well prepared for the cross-examination. Good work.	I think the cooperation between you and your witness is really natural. To improve, I think you could add more transition words in your direct to make your direct have a more clear structure. \r\n\r\nNever thank your honor. \r\n\r\nExhibit 11 has already been entered into evidence. You do not need to enter those again. Be aware of what evidence is entered.	Objection: \r\n- Speculation\r\n\r\nI noticed your transitions from part to part in your cross-examination. However, I think you can add more pauses between parts. \r\n\r\nNever thank your honor. \r\n\r\nGood content coverage, but I don't think all information included in your cross is needed. You could select those more related to your team's case theory to ask.	9	8	8	6	Vally girl? LOL\r\n\r\nI think you can lower your camera, so we can see your hand gestures more clearly. Overall, good hand gestures. \r\n\r\nI think your tone is compliant with your character. However, the content is not that relevant to your character. You could integrate more jokes into your script.	Good responses and good explanations. \r\n\r\nGood improvising. \r\n\r\nI think probably you explained too much in the cross. You need to balance between firm, short answers and long explanations.	Add more transitions into your script. I know you have already added some, but you need to emphasize those when conducting the direct.	Never thank your honor.\r\n\r\nYou do not have to testify everything in the affidavit. \r\n\r\nYou do not need to clarify if it's a "yes" or "no" with the witness at every single point.  You only need to clarify those essential points. Checking with the witness if their answers is "yes" or "no" indirectly reflects your poor ability to control the witness. \r\n\r\nYou cannot cut off the witness while they are still answering your questions. That's impolite. I think you need to control the witness more.	7	7	8	7	Prepare a mic. Unstable Internet.  You are hard to hear. \r\n\r\nPractice more, and do not look at your script. Looking at the script limits your performance. Add more hand gestures and body language. Merely the changes in tone are not enough to build an impressive character. \r\n\r\nI think you can add more character. The mic you have is an excellent tool for you to build your character (for example, a 网红).\r\n\r\nI have noticed your changes in emotion, but those are little bit unrealistic. (or maybe due to Internet lagging).	I think you perform better in the cross-examination. Reading from the script really limits your performance in the direct. \r\n\r\nGood balance between short, firm answers and long explanations. \r\n\r\nI think you can be more emotional and maintain a character from the direct.	Objection:\r\n- Calls for speculation: Good arguments. \r\n- Hearsay: Exhibit 4\r\n\r\nI think you are professional when dealing with unexpected tech issues. \r\n\r\nThe unstable Internet connection limits your performance.	Objection: \r\n- Calling for speculation: Exhibit 3 is not entered into evidence. \r\n- Hearsay: Exhibit 4 - As you are not using the manual to provide the truth of matters asserted, you can just read the part of the manual out in the court. Reading statements out of court not offer for the truth of matters asserted is a hearsay exception by definition. \r\n\r\nYou sound really aggressive by saying "Please reply yes or not. " Try to be nice and kind while controlling your witness. \r\n\r\nBe aware of what exhibits are entered into evidence. \r\n\r\nThe structure of your cross-examination is not very clear. I suggest you add more transitions and not include unnecessary parts in your script.	7	Notes: \r\n- Theme: Evade, deception, and property. \r\n- Narrative: checked\r\n- Criminal charge: Guilty of robbery of the first degree and theft by deception. \r\n- Elements: aid, physically injured due to the defendant action, motive(?)\r\n- Burden of proof: Beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n- Good hand gestures.

217	8	Good decorum\r\nStart with theme - followed through\r\nActive body language\r\nGood visual effect\r\nClear structure\r\n\r\nConsider having some variations in tone & pace, e.g. slow down with back story build-ups and speed up for the parts you want to emphasise - having the same tone the whole time makes it difficult for the jury to follow your points	7	Good decorum\r\nHaving your eyes & body fixed would make you look like reading off script\r\nNot much body language, consider adding some in parts you want to emphasise\r\nNeeds a clearer theme\r\n\r\nConsider having some variations in tone & pace, speed up & emphasise\r\nIf you make a mistake, don't stop and say sorry, act natural	7	8	7	7	Consistent big character\r\nSeems to be looking at notes?\r\nThe facial expression is slightly inconsistent, you seem to be more in character when speaking but not so much when not saying anything	Consistent character off script	Try to engage with the witness more (i.e. act like you are listening to them, follow your next question based on what they say, connect the questions when write the script)\r\nTone is a bit flat - even for scripted direct examination you can underscore questions that really matter for you case\r\n\r\nNot a criticism: if you want to change objection you can just change it, no need to explain your reason	Good close ended questions, control the witness a bit more by asking them to give yes or no answers, you are letting the witness explain herself a bit too much\r\n\r\nToo generous to the witness overall, controlling the witness to save time & get the answers you want	6	7	7	6	Seems to be reading\r\nCamera angle is not favourable\r\nNot much dramatic character	Good being evasive with questions	Acts like engaging & responding to the witness, connect each question more closely\r\nTone change helps, consider further that to emphasise certain questions\r\nRoad sign language that direct the jury is helpful, try to divide your direct into different larger sections/topics and use language like "now let's talk about..." to guide the jury through your case	Good decorum in addressing the witness\r\nQuestion seems to be scripted\r\nStick to close-ended questions\r\nYou let the witness explain too much, try control them better\r\nDon't interrupt the witness, ask for yes or no questions in advance\r\nBe ready to go off script if the witness discloses extra information	8	7	8	6	Can follow up your character further & more consistently\r\nGood job in pausing before answering like you just heard the question	Good responding off script	Good decorum\r\nResponding to the witness & following up questions based on the witness' testimony, but do slow down when you are doing this, since you are acting like you just heard the information	Seems to be reading off script during cross, be ready to go off script or lose the script overall\r\nCan control the witness better\r\nNot a criticism, but you can definitely have a longer cross than that	6	5	6	8	Character a bit too plain\r\nLooks like reading	Too cooperative, plain character\r\nConsider using answer sandwiches	Good decorum with witness\r\nSeems scripted and a bit unfamiliar\r\nProject more confidence\r\nFight with objections a bit more	Familiar with roe & procedures\r\nLeading question doesn't necessarily mean a question like "was it A?" or any question that sounds like yes or no, but rather a question that only leaves the option of A or B\r\nGood close ended questions\r\nBe careful not to interrupt the witness\r\nGood sense of impeachment, but asked too many questions, just pull up the affidavit, ask fair & accurate, (and signature if you want)\r\nDon't badger the witness or interrupt\r\nYou have proven that the witness is unreliable, move on and don't impeach the same thing with three same questions\r\nIf the witness can't find it, don't say "it's not in the affidavit, right", say "you can't find it, right". Stick to facts that does not require any assumption	5	5	6	8	Seems to be reading\r\nPlain character, very plain	Way too cooperative, the attorney just asked whether you are dishonest, and you just said "yes". Don't just give it to the other side	Seems to be reading\r\nRespond to the witness & follow up questions based on the witness' testimony to appear engaging\r\nWhen you get objected, don't panic and be ready to go off script, rephrase the questions (e.g. change some words to guide the witness, break compound down into two questions, etc.) Don't just give up\r\nGeneral tip: don't let the witness just answer a big chunk of things that may get objected if you can break them down, don't compound	Relevant & timely objections\r\nThe "you aren't always honest" question can be risky by itself, if the witness denies and stall for time it could get tricky. Make sure you follow it up closely with the fake camera question, especially if the witness isn't as cooperative at this point.\r\nWell done with fast-paced & closely linked yes or no questions. Make sure you are ready to control the witness since this witness has been very cooperative.	7	7	8	7	Facial expression is a bit plain for a very emotional character, but consistent with the character (even during objections - well done)	A bit cooperative\r\nA bit out of character	Good response to objections\r\nCould maybe be more engaging to a witness so emotional\r\nConnect the questions more closely\r\nBest way to avoid narrative objections (either they would be granted or not an objection would stop your witness)\r\nTimely objections to protect your witness	Timely objections\r\nSlight point: Some judges/counsels may construe your facial expressions as disrespectful\r\n"truth" is a word free for interpretations, if you are going to ask it, ask after you've laid good foundation\r\nDon't let the witness explain their case with an open ended question\r\nIf you are reading from affidavit/evidence, say "I'd like you to look at line...", read, say "did I read that correctly?" \r\nGood attempt at using road signs to guide the jury through different sections of your cross, try to further that by dividing your cross into larger sections to help the jury focus\r\nDon't let the witness explain so much\r\n\r\nI may be understanding this correctly but you are pursuing many questions trying to prove the defendant committed theft by deception while the defendant pleads guilty to that charge?	7	Good follow up with theme\r\nToo fast, slow down, vary your tone & pace\r\nNot much body language, camera angle not favourable\r\nGood visual aid \r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to stick to your theme in rebuttal, personally, turning lights on and off every time is enjoyable to watch\r\nGood rebuttal to break down opponent's points and refer to testimonies\r\nSmall point: although rebuttal is probably the most suitable section for such fast-paced style, but that's normally because you have little time. In this case you have 6 minutes - so slow down, control your pace and give a convincing speech	6	Good decorum\r\nSeems to be reading, hence lacking in delivery\r\nFlat tone\r\nSeems unfamiliar with the script\r\nSame with opening, a clear theme would help	58	38	48	44	222	43	46	45	227	47	t
215	7	Better timing. The theme is a little bit unclear.	7	It would be great if the statement is memorized. It would allow a lot more interaction with the jury.	7	7	8	8	Loved the character, excited to see what you can do off script:)	I like how you held onto your character but you can sound a little bit overly aggressive toward the defendant which can make the jury question if you are biased.	Repeat the question if there was an objection. Also I hope you can stay a little still during the questioning... It gets a little bit distracting but no big deal:)	Good job raising objections and arguing them. Write down the page and line number next to every question in preparation of an impeachment procedure because it saves time (impeachments run on your clock).	10	8	9	8	Loved the Russian accent and loved the character	Well done staying in character and holding on to your points.	The hearsay objections very well argued.	Try not to raise the same objection twice.	8	8	7	9	I have been told that police officers usually don't call themselves cops... Don't know if it is true but I will refrain from doing it.	Good job staying calm under high pressure.	Good job staying calm and trying to keep the case together. The case can be constructed better to avoid the objections.	Well argued objections.\r\nI don't quite understand the point of impeaching Kimball.\r\nPay attention to your tone when you are trying to have the witness admit that she knows the officer. It could look bad on you if not done correctly.\r\n\r\nVery well constructed case.	8	10	8	8	I like the story but it sounds a little scripted	I like your presentation during the cross. The direct sounded a little bit agitated but the cross was a lot better. The overall character is very good.	Well constructed case.	Good job getting what you want out of this witness.	8	7	8	8	I like the story but it sounds a little bit scripted.	You do sound less assertive compared to the direct. Maybe try to keep it consistent.	Well argued objection. Good job clarifying with the redirect.	Good job getting what you want out of the witness.	10	10	8	7	Super likable character. Loved it!	Really good cross. You stayed in character and held on to your point. Very impressed when asked to speculate.	Well constructed case and logic. Also very well argued speculation objection.	Try to be more familiar with the definition of each objection.\r\n\r\nAsked for speculation with the question "whether or not have formed muscle memory"	8	good job weaving details that happened during the trial into the closing. Slow down. No hurry.\r\n\r\nThe muscle memory part seemed a little weird since none of the witnesses confirmed that the defendant will have muscle memory.\r\n\r\nThe rebuttal on muscle memory is very risky.	9	I like how you point out the Prosecution's case is based on guesses and linked that to reasonable doubt. Good use of demonstratives.	47	108	140	160	163	162	167	136	164	138	t
214	7	"Had a clear aim in the dark." It's a good theme. You have good volume and command. You can use your first paragraph to tell a story about what happened from the Prosecution's perspective.  You can take your time more, make each paragraph its own important point. Use your command to build the story against the defendant, and then use the facts to forecast how this case is going to prove that  your story is correct (the most reasonable).	4	For the next trial, you can easily adjust your camera so that we can see your face, your upper torso, and your background. Your hand gesture takes up a lot of space on your screen when you present so close to the camera.  You keep the same tone throughout the whole opening. You can section your opening off into several paragraphs.	8	7	6	5	Good background, setup, and witness costume. You do a good job with your accent and overall character.	Good job being responsive. You found a way to answer simple questions but add a short response to others.	You've got a good setup, we can see and hear you just fine and you look prepared. You can look into the camera (around the camera) so it looks like you're looking at the jury/witness.	You can control more on the witness. This witness is their character witness, you can control them by pinning them to a "yes" or a "no".  You can also ask different ends to your questions, things like "isn't that true?", "correct?", "do I have that right?". Your questions are yes/no questions, so make sure the witness gives you the yes or no you're looking for. Have your questions build to a point. Pick one fact you want to establish for the jury - and use about 7-8 questions to get to that fact. These are called "pockets" and about 3 of them is all you need to make your cross.	6	7	8	7	The character does come through here with the costume, script, and tone which is good. You can take more time so that the jury can process all the content you're giving us.	Good responses on cross. You seem to know the facts, and you keep the same character on direct.	Your witness gives you the opportunity to be credible here, you share similar reactions to the judge, the jury, and the other attorney, and it builds your credibility doing the direct. It adds to your overall score because it looks unscripted, as if you had not rehearsed this with the witness beforehand. Good objections to 704(b) - ultimate issue, and Lack of Foundation.  The judge is right, the witness can give you an answer that strengthens your case. Good character evidence under 609(b).	Great clarity right off the bat. There really aren't any objections that have happened up to this point - so any "break" in your overall flow is not what you want. You want to control their witnesses, who are over-the-top on character, and ask question after question to get yes after yes. Also, the one time the witness asked you to be louder, you had GREAT volume, keep that up throughout the entire exam. Good job picking up on the witness answer - "you're not very clear?". Make sure the case packet doesn't allow the witness to say things like "I don't remember."	6	4	6	6	As an investigator turned expert, you likely would not wear a New York Yankees hat. I do like the Zoom background for this character, however.	Your answers on cross can be too long. It's good to not just answer "yes" or "no", but make sure you do answer the question.	There may need to be some more foundation for the prongs of 702 before Kimball becomes an expert. Things like the method Kimball used, if it was standard and reliable, it Kimball reliably applied that method to the facts of this case, things like that.	You can definitely object and make the Prosecution lay all the foundation under 702 to qualify them as an expert. Very good objection and catch as to the term "robbery".  It is 702 and 403 for them to definitively classify this as a robbery. Keep in mind it may get overruled with the way they phrased it. There is no "improper speculation" objection, but definitely keep the 702. This witness is an expert in "financial crime" not in criminal investigation, and even if she was she needs to keep it to her observations so ask for a limiting instruction there. The term "robbery" can invoke another phrasing to your same objection called "improper legal conclusion" given the classification of this as a robbery.	5	5	3	8	Try to make your answers very charactery if you can. You have a good setup, and your direct was cut short, but take advantage of your time on direct and cross to seize attention from the jury.	Make sure you're prepared for open ended questions on cross, they can seriously benefit your case because you can continue to talk and talk without as much limitation.	Your camera angle can be fixed quite easily. You can move back from the lens, presenting your direct as if you were in person. One sustained objection is totally fine, take your time, continue with a new pocket, and you should be good to go.  Try not to let that end your direct.	Good 403.  Good tone entering your direct. Good control, saying, "Can you answer my question with a yes or a no?".  You ask one speculative question about *why* Jackie Hunter was not hired. It may be based in hearsay, it may go to effect on the listener, just be ready for that objection to come your way. You had it done and over with when you finished your cross. No need to object on redirect, stay clean and no need to risk anything there.	4	4	5	7	Try to get your camera level with your eyes. Looking down and to the corner does not show the jury much. Try to not read, or if you do read try to make it below the camera so it looks like you are still directing everything towards the jury. The more you run through your direct, the more you can inject character, style, tone, volume, pacing, and clarity.	Be prepared for hard-hitting questions, open-ended questions, and just general cross questions to come your way. Prepare answers ahead of time if needed.	You have a good setup, but there are objects and clothes in the back you could easily remove so that we can just focus on you. Be prepared for hearsay, it's 804, it looks like you have a stipulation, and you can offer it under 804(b). There's foundational issues here with the events Kaminsky lays out.	You objected "Calls for Hearsay" to a statement that they just brought out through the answer. This is just "Hearsay". "Calls for Hearsay" only works for a question that implies a statement from out of court in the answer.  You got a limiting instruction, but you could have gotten that fully stricken by arguing the 804 (unavailable witness) you had the judge on your side. They need to point to the exception to hearsay directly, you don't have to offer a limiting instruction. Great final question "Whit".	7	4	6	6	You do a great job right out of the gate with credibility, character, sadness, etc. Keep that up. It would be more effective if you built up towards it. Good job on direct.	Answer questions on cross first with a yes or a no. Then from there you can elaborate on particular answers - all while trying to be responsive.  If you can say yes, say yes. It adds credibility. Some questions are simple and easy, it makes it much more messy to not answer with a yes or a no, just take your time, understand the question, and then answer. You don't need to add "because" on each answer.	You can easily fix camera angle, continue to wear blazer, decent objections. Make sure your witness's audio does not echo on direct. Good objections.	There's a lot of missed objections - I get that once the first got overruled and time is pushing all-loss you may not want to make all of them. But things like 403/relevance to how the victim was as a person. Speculation big time, LoF as to how the witness is speculating and talking about things they simply do not know about. You have good control occasionally, but you seem tired and the witness is pushing you to frustration. Relax, smile, continue that control, get the yes or no. Don't say "I don't really need a long explanation about the question." Just say, "that's a yes?", "is that a yes?", don't ask open-ended questions. Don't get too frustrated, and create a flow.	8	Great story intro. You were the first attorney in the round to be physically dynamic, and it separated you from the rest. Your co-counsel did a great job throughout trial with objections, this was a good way to show your presentation ability in contrast to everyone else. Great changes in tone from really loud to really quiet.	7	Good job being physically dynamic. You stood up, it looked prepared, rehearsed, and well done.  You can definitely slow down. You can emphasize points like, "The prosecution CANNOT be sure..." about ____. Make that reasonable doubt come in because that's what seals in your case. You have all day to poke holes and show reasonable doubt in the Prosecution's case. Great quadruplet with the: "No one is a 100% sure..."	49	172	256	55	98	257	52	53	93	51	t
278	7	A pretty well-structured opening statement. Try to include more pretrial matters, ask for the judge's preference of screen sharing, motion to strike, pre-admitted exhibits and party representative.	5	It's too obvious that you are reading the script. Your speech doesn't contain any emotion. Good that you mentioned the burden of proof, but please remember to mention the charge as well.	6	7	7	6	It's kind of weird you call Billy Issacs first Because you can't assume the judge and jury know all about the case! It's better if you can add some character. As a witness, you SHOULD NOT look at the script because you are the one who experienced the whole case and told the jury your story. If you are looking at the script, this dramatically lowers your credibility!	Be more confident about your answer. Don't shake your body a lot.	The good manner in entering exhibits into evidence. If the judge already overruled your objection, don't argue anymore, raise a different one later is a better way. Say your honor may I be heard before saying anything. Don't argue with the opposing counsel. Don't Say thank you, your honor. Say Yes your honor.	Control your witness, and be aware of the possibility of impeachment. Be prepared for any answer the witness might give to your questions. Design your question well! Be familiar with the rules of evidence. Be more confident, don't be upset just by one sustained objection, and show that you are a professional lawyer! Learn more about the impeachment procedure! Don't say things like in your affidavit .......	6	8	7	8	Good presentation. Don't look at your script again.	Generally good response and good use of the sandwich structure.	Do you think it's a good calling order if you still need to ask the question "who's Bowman" when directing the second witness? Missed call for hearsay objections.	Good manner.	6	5	5	7	Your glass reflects that you are looking at Your script. Your eyes are not evening moving......	Be familiar with your affidavit bro. It's really bad if you are just intimidated by impeachment.	The narrative has nothing to do with direct or cross. Remember to re-emphasize your case theory when objected. It's a good chance.\r\nYou are reading the script, and you are not even familiar with it.\r\nBe more familiar with the procedure of entering exhibits into evidence.\r\nBe more familiar with the rules of evidence.	Missed hearsay objection to exhibit 1. \r\nDon't talk to the witness	8	7	7	6	Good character and accent and make-up! A really interesting story and case theory. If you lack money, you have a larger incentive to cooperate with Poole to steal money.		Raise some objections to help you witness even if they might be overruled. Like badgering the witness, counsel testifying, etc.	Be clear about the impeachment procedure. Don't talk or argue with your witness. When you finish your impeachment just move on to the following questions. Don't cut into your witness's statement. She made up a lot of information, and you can impeach by omission.	6	6	7	7	You don't have any character, and you are not familiar with your script.	Just answer yes to the questions it's on your affidavit. Don't be too defensive because this lowers the credibility. Try to answer JUST yes or no.	Good objection to speculation.\r\nMotion to strike after objection sustained!	Don't always say your answer is a yes. \r\nBe more clear about your questions, and be more fluent to show your confidence, don't be overwhelmed by nerves.\r\nTry to rephrase the question if the objection is sustained, don't just give up!	6	6	5	8	A good answer to questions. You can improve by having some character like the outfit, decoration, make-up, accent, etc.	Be more familiar with your affidavit. You don't have to be that defensive. Just answer yes to the questions it doesn't matter that much, at least not as bad as being impeached.	Sorry to mention this but try to be professional in your dressing. Don't wear a t-shirt as an attorney.\r\nPlease be familiar with the rules of evidence. NEVER acknowledge the objection. Even if you don't have any response, please say I stand by my argument!\r\nYou can consult with your co-counsel if you don't know how to argue.\r\nA typical response to speculation objection is this is based on the witness's rational perception. For example, you can say I hear his voice, and I'm familiar.\r\nIf you are not prepared, don't re-direct, it's pretty risky.	You don't have to object to "calls for speculation/hearsay." You should wait until the witness's statement and object directly to that.\r\nDon't overuse hearsay, you are not familiar with the definition of hearsay. It's an OUT OF COURT   STATEMENT made for the TRUTH OF MATTER asserted. \r\nYou don't have to say you are impeaching. Just go for it. But good impeachment procedure. You don't need any follow-up questions or conversations with the witness. Just move on when you finish impeachment.	8	Your closing is weakened because you mentioned some arguments against bowman that hasn't been crossed out of Bowman. \r\nGenerally good storytelling but try to present more evidence. During the closing argument, you should appeal more to ethos than pathos.\r\nYou can also improve by structuring the speech better. Now it seems to be thrown out of evidence randomly. It's better if there's some logic line.	8	A good presentation of evidence and I like your confidence	68	41	106	71	72	108	107	68	70	109	t

197	6	You have a lot of passion in your opening.  Be careful that you don't turn your statement into an argument, that needs to be saved for closing.	6	I like the use of the theme and clear explanation of the case.	7	7	7	6	Ms. Liu, I like the character, but if you push it too hard you seem less believable.	Same as direct.  Fun character but you are a little over the top and it takes it out of the realm of believability.	Alex, your direct is very conversational.	Ms. Wan, your questions are solid, but I don't think you have it all memorized.  If you did, it would help with the questioning and your reaction to changes by the witness.	7	7	7	8	Really fun character, I love it.	Still a fun character, but a bit over the top.  You have to keep it believable.	Direct exam was fine, story came across.	Really good cross.  I though you handled the witness very well and you were able to get the information you wanted.  Nice job.	8	8	7	6	You are the most believable witness so far.  Clear testimony and I could see you as that character.  Very good.		Solid direct.  You handled the objection very well.	Good objection and argued well.  I know you were having internet issues, but you have to be respectful to the court.	6	5	6	7	You started out fine on direct but I didn't feel a lot of character from you.	You have to give me a lot more on cross.  Just answering yes or no is not effective.	Your direct started great but you got stuck on the objection.  Don't ever give up!	Cross was fine.  Good objection although you need to use the actual evidence code when pointing out an objection.	7	6	8	9	Very believable witness.  I liked the subtle use of character.	Still very believable on cross.  Try to give me more than yes or no.  The questions you give your opinion or clarification are the best.  Don't give up.  You seemed to shut down at the end.	I thought you had a very good direct and you handled the objections fine.	Your knowledge of the objections is excellent.  You handled them and the language perfectly.  I especially enjoyed allowing the hearsay with the limiting instruction.  Smart.  Excellent cross.  You did a very good job handling a witness that was not forthcoming.	7	7	7	7	It is very important that you come across as believable.  The emotion at the beginning was good, but you turned it off abruptly and that made it seem fake.	You gave the correct amount of information on cross without just answering his questions yes or no, good job.	Your direct got the information you needed but could have been a lot more clear and concise.	You seemed to give up and then tried to control the witness with yes or no questions.  A better way would be to tell the witness that wasn't the question you asked or object to nonresponsive.	8	Very good closing.  You did an excellent job with your presentation and the speed of your closing.	7	You are starting a little fast.  Your closing was very clear.	49	159	256	98	55	257	51	52	93	53	t
200	7	- Conceal, connect, complicit\r\n- Lights turned off, with a sickening thud, officer never woke up -> Something missing here. \r\n- You're making it clear what you need to prove, and I appreciate that. \r\n- How does skimming cash tie to the robbery?\r\n- Good weaving of the theme, good structure. \r\n- "Three witnesses" usually better to weave them into a story. 1st 2nd 3rd is generally not a good structure.\r\n- When explaining what the witnesses will testify to, it's good to find a way to explain why what they are saying is important. First witness explaining easiness of a ride?\r\n- Sometimes eyes are off camera.\r\n- The explanation of concealed connected complicit should have occurred during the second iteration of the theme.	9	No information, no involvement, no intention.\r\nGood presentation of the theme. \r\nYour voice is unfortunately a little quiet, so it can be hard to hear you even with my headphones turned up. But good intonation.\r\nExcellent hand gestures - 3 key facts, hand gesture of 3\r\nYou know I like the powerpoint here. Great way of tying the theme to three central questions.\r\nMoving around too much. I can tell its intentional though it can be distracting.\r\nMost of your hand gestures are below your torso, so I cannot see them. \r\nVery clearly presenting the theory.\r\nGood example of weaving the witnesses into a story as opposed to presenting a list. \r\nWhen talking about no intention, your statements border on argument. I'm not docking for it, though, just something I'm noticing. \r\nGenerally should not go in-depth as to the prosecutions burden and reasonable doubt in an opening statement - would have preferred that this time was spent fleshing out defense theory and explaining their witnesses. This should be reseved for closing.	9	8	8	8	- This witness's costume is great. Love the earrings & lipstick.\r\n- This witness has a great persona when presenting.\r\n- Very clear language when explaining what's going on.\r\n- I notice language from this direct is matching the opening, which is great! You put good emphasis on the "easy to operate" language in the opening.	- You lost credibility by confidently saying "yes" to "are you angry" and then hedging when the question was rephrased.\r\n- You were fighting but it wasn't fighting to the point where I wanted to dock points. And you didn't fight when the points got very bad, which I respect. Though answering "probably" to there being accidents and safety issues over the years does make me raise my eyebrows.	- Generally recommend against "why are you here" questions - explaining why a witness is here and guiding the direct is the job of the attorney. \r\n- Good hearsay back and forth about whether something is hearsay & business record. What is the truth of the matter being asserted here?\r\n- Great job adapting to lay the foundation for the tickets. I'm adding a point because you did that. \r\n- Good job introducing exposition by explaining the tickets, how park numbers are up, and how Longstreet suspected there was a skimming operation. The defendant concedes this, though. \r\n- I don't think these ticket stubs actually contain statements that are hearsay. But this was a nice back and forth between attorneys! Great job to both of you. \r\n- Excellent looping - "You mentioned two things..."\r\n- Good catch with the speculation objection	- You guys are making fantastic objection arguments. I love this.\r\n- Your cross started strong - I'd rephrase the anger question so that you don't loose momentum due to a speculation objection\r\n- Don't talk over the witness even when she's getting wriggly\r\n- Great job replying to the witness when she was wriggling\r\n- The witness answering "probably" to the accident question is a great example of a nugget - I would have harped on that.	8	8	7	9	- The witness's testimony is smooth. Very natural presentation. \r\n- Even though the testimony feels organic, it makes sense. Good presentation.	- You stayed conversational and chill into the cross. I thought it was great! You didn't act like someone with an agenda, I thought your demeanor was similar to that of direct.	- Again, not a fan of the "tell us why you're here" questions. The same information can be gotten from more directed questions.\r\n- Unfortunate that the emphasis of these directs is on the wristbands when the defendants concede the money skimming scheme.  Clever of the defendants to concede this.\r\n- The reason I asked you for evidence of a conspiracy so far is because you initially said that you established a conspiracy. Good to change the argument to give you more time.\r\n- "Did you observe the incident that caused injury to officer Thomas" is leading - be careful!\r\n- Honestly taking a hot second to think about your response is not a bad thing at all. Though if you need to think a bit let me know because I was worried my connectivity was bad.	- Loved the hearsay objection. Good on you for renewing it when you heard another problematic statement.\r\n- Great witness control throughout the entire exam\r\n- "Mmhmmm" is not a yes for the record, so you need to make sure the witness gets a yes or a no.\r\n- Great responses to the hearsay objections.\r\n- Simple questions, which is good.	9	8	9	9	- Your explain your opinions clearly, in terms that are easy to understand. The back and forth between witness and attorney here felt natural. Great job, guys.	- When the attny emphasizes stuff like "best guy you've ever known" you hedged, which gave her the opportunity to ask the question multiple times. If it's in your affidavit, just say yes.\r\n- You need justice!!!\r\n- Not too flighty which is good. \r\n- Fighting again about the photographic evidence, though clarifying about the text messages is good.	- This direct does a good job of introducing the expert witness.\r\n- The 702(a) objection and response were excellent. You guys are so great.\r\n- Direct does a good job of weaving through the qualifications in 702. Very nicely done. Very easy to understand.\r\n- Could have some more looping: Instead of "what does this mean for the park" could say "what does [the ticket skimming, etc] mean for the park"?\r\n- You guys should know that I am not doing a great job of keeping track of the names - this exam would be easier to follow if I knew who "S-Cam" was in relation to the case - suspect, co-conspirator, etc?\r\n- Oh wow the witness's opinion was as to the existence of a conspiracy! Well that makes those earlier objections easier.	- Excellent argument for 702(a). \r\n- The fact that you're using rule numbers when making objections gives you a massive boost in credibility.\r\n- I was wondering why you didn't object to the text messages on direct. Makes sense that you would use it on cross. The red boxes help! Kudos to your tech support making that happen.\r\n- Simple, common sense cross. Presented very clearly and effectively. \r\n- No need to say "I'll ask my question again," but yeah that was good witness control. \r\n- I would have sustained an argumentative to "You ONLY conducted 6 interviews."\r\n- Yay for citing 801 when talking about hearsay.\r\n- You phrased your "nobody indicated" question in a way such that the witness's answer couldn't make sense. \r\n- "In none of these interviews did anyone indicate..." is a pretty long question but I can see how it's tying into your theme. Clever! I would recommend finding a way to shorten the question so that it's punchier. \r\n- The cross is going a little long. \r\n- Ultimate issue argument wasn't necessary - no objection was made to it.	6	7	8	9	- I'm looking at your screen and I can see your eyes moving from left to right as you give your testimony. It makes me think that you're reading your exam answers. The testimony doesn't quite sound natural, either; it sounds like you're reading.\r\n- Note that reading on its own isn't really that bad; you do sound interested and engaged. But I can't give a score similar to the previous exams because the other witnesses were very clearly not reading.\r\n- Added to your score when your energy went up during the "pressing the stop button" portion of the DX because that was some good acting. That was great!	- The jokes are weird sorry. Because you're the defendant, adding quips after being nervous kind of feel out of place. Had you been a lay witness or someone not directly being accused, this would have been fine.\r\n- The emphasis on the alleged co-conspirator being "your friend" isn't great given the fact that prosecution is saying you guys conspired together. Unless I'm mixing up people in which case my bad.\r\n- Still the energy you're bringing to the cross about the mistake is great.	- Interesting strategy point to call the defendant first.\r\n- I want to note something special here - attny does a great job of fading into background and letting witness shine on DX. The questions posed are natural and conversational and lets the pair get into a good flow.\r\n- "Do you need a moment" was weird. Happened too quickly to feel artificial.\r\n- Pretty good exam! It does what it needs to do and it didn't give opposing council any good opportunities to object. \r\n- Your state v Compton argument was on the right track to stopping this piece of evidence from getting in. Be careful not to overstate what the case law stands for, though - Compton isn't a catch all to remove all police reports, it only covers 803(6) and 803(8). You also have to be prepared to argue that when there is hearsay within hearsay, rule 805 requires exceptions to all levels of hearsay! Had you said that, I would have sustained. This document should not have been admitted. \r\n\r\nReDX: I recommend not saying "very briefly" - some judges will hold you to that. Same for "lastly" - this cues in on the opposing attorney to object!	- Yay power-point stuff. I prefer the red box as opposed to zoom in.\r\n- Short and simple questions. Nicely done!\r\n- The short and simple questions gave this cross a good pace. \r\n- "You were the only one behind the controls" stuck with me as a good question. That might just be me, but I found it impactful. \r\n- Excellent cross on the distinction between a button and a lever. \r\n- Oh Exhibit 3 is a mess I have no idea what to take away from this.\r\n- Very glad you're recognizing the hearsay within hearsay issue. \r\n- I HIGHLY recommend that you look at rule 805. I am intentionally making a wrong ruling. Sorry guys. \r\n- However, even though you got this document in, I don't think it did much for you. I want those cute red bars.	7	8	8	8	- I have to say the anti-capitalist environmentalist witness does a great job of appealing to your audience.\r\n- It's not as obvious that you're reading but I do see your eyes moving left and right occasionally. But the exam does feel more natural.	- Friendly, and stays in character. You don't fight and I appreciate that.	- You also do a good job of letting the witness shine.\r\n- I'm not certain what the point of this exam is, though? Would have nice to have some more obvious framing at the beginning. I may have just gotten distracted by the anti-capitalist sentiment.	- When I heard the words "in my opinion" from a lay witness, I was expecting to hear a speculation objection. A witness's opinion as to whether or not someone did something voluntarily is textbook speculation. I also was hoping to hear an objection to the last question, when the witness said she believed the defendant was framed. \r\n- I like using the photos to illustrate points in your exam.	8	9	8	8	- Love the energy you're bringing. I can also tell you're reading but this presentation feels way more natural. If i didn't see your eyes moving, I wouldn't have known.\r\n- I feel like a lot of these jokes would hit better if the timing was varied. You talk about Beyonce with the same breath you talk about normal facts for the case. The pacing got a little weirder as the exam went on.\r\n- "There were no gunshots no screams etc" is a weird thing to volunteer without a prompt from the attny. Why not ask another question?	- Not fighting, doesn't seem to have a stake in this, and I appreciate that. You're listening and seem to be genuinely trying to do a good job to answer honestly. \r\n- I can see both of you checking the affidavit at the same time and it's very funny.	- Confident introduction! Though noting "you and I know each other" is a little weird.\r\n- Ok I was confused as to why this witness was called until you asked her about any mistakes she made when operating the ride.\r\n- Really good presentation of the point that any employee can make mistakes when operating that ride. \r\n- Weight not admissibility argument doesn't do it for me when it comes to character evidence - 404 is 100% a question of admissibility. It's ok though, 404 is messy. I don't think 405 gives you an out - consider 404(2)(B)?\r\n- I don't agree that every single word in that exhibit is a statement. \r\n- Your hearsay within hearsay argument was very articulate. If we had had time, I would have asked you both to flesh it out more. \r\n- Good redx! Sweet and simple!	- I agreed with you about the 404 objection when your objection was to the defendant's character for being a good person. However, once you changed the objection to the defendant's character for truthfulness, I had to overrule because of 608.\r\n- The witness doesn't seem to be fighting you, but the pacing of this cross feels a little choppy. \r\n- If something is a hearsay exception, it DOES have a truth value. If something is not being offered for its truth, then it is not hearsay. Because you are not offering the exhibit for its truth value, you should say it is not hearsay, NOT that there is an exception. \r\n- You have a lot of filler words - "I want to remind you", "I want to stress here" - your exam would be better for cutting these filler words out. \r\n- You found your pacing later on into the exam. Got smoother!\r\n- Shame that you didn't have time to explore an impeachment. But I do think your choice not to do it was a smart one - I doubt you had a lot of time left and that was a big commitment.	10	Pre-closing conspiracy argument:\r\nThe fact that you prepared this evidentiary argument in a way that sounds like a closing is great. Mad props to you. Did a fantastic job taking your most important points and presenting them in a quick and concise way.\r\n\r\nClosing:\r\n- Great introduction. Could have had a bit more of an emphasis on the opening to tie things together. \r\n- Emphasis on the bracelet scheme is good, because most of your evidence definitely supports this. Unfortunately it feels like robbery is being put on the back-burner. \r\n- Great job weaving the facts in a way that tells the jury a story of what happened. \r\n- Great pacing. \r\n- I wish there were photos during this closing. \r\n- Great job including the theme to tie it all together in the end.\r\n\r\nRebuttal:\r\n- I cannot overemphasize how much I was hoping you would flip the theme and I'm glad you addressed it. Wasn't a hard flip but you addressed each piece of their theme step by and that's also very good. Not sure if it's a good time to talk about responsibility and who has that responsibility, though - that kind of language tends to belong in negligence trials.\r\n- Mentioning officer Thomas not being able to get his life back was VERY spicy.	10	Pre-closing conspiracy argument: \r\nMost of the time was spent on the legal standards and explaining the circumstances surrounding the objection. Because I, the judge, asked you to make this argument, you could have done away with all of that and focused on your points. But they were good points.\r\n\r\nClosing:\r\n- Yay PowerPoint slides.\r\n- I'm sure I'd get annoyed with these if they were included for too long or too much, but you don't overuse them and I appreciate that.\r\n- Excellent job weaving in the theme throughout this closing. I feel like this theme was used throughout the defense's case in chief more consistently. \r\n- Great attack on the text messages. And I do like the zoom-in this time I think it looks cool. \r\n- This closing in some ways feels choreographed like a movie. \r\n- Good that you're taking notes! But pointing at your notes doesn't do anything for me - I can't read them from here.\r\n- I'm glad you incorporated the redirect in your argument! Excellent job explicitly mentioning moments in trial and making them a part of your argument.\r\n- Good, I'm glad you're noting that theft is already conceded and that robbery was at issue here.	53	162	84	14	88	89	15	91	18	17	t
198	8	Good storytelling. Your theme is a little convoluted, but understandable. Good tone, but try to have more variation. I like how you tried to use your hand gesture, but try to move with PURPOSE. Your camera angle is way way too low. Adjust it so that you are looking horizontally at the camera. I think three questions come more naturally before the evidence section. Your burden is a little late as well. But overall, very nice structure and very fluent. Could work on delivery to make it more dramatic and more appealing narrative.	7	Pretrial: turn on your camera when you are speaking.\r\n\r\nOpening: Good tone. Strong start of your opening. It appears you are reading off a script, which makes your otherwise convincing narrative less passionate. I like personalizing the defendant at the start of your opening. I would have more variation of tone and voice when you are telling the story - when you try to depict an emergent scene, vary your tone that way. I think your story is a little too long, tho it is dramatic enough to catch my attention. Your theme is fun.	8	5	8	7	Good character in general - I think you are very likable as a witness. I do believe you can have more jokes or character moments later in the direct. You take natural pauses before answering questions, just like how real witnesses would speak, which is great.	You sound less likable immediately on cross. Don't be too evasive as it compromises your credibility and otherwise very likable character. Try to have short responses and agree to most of the questions; if you disagree, just say no and let the opposing counsel rephrase the question. \r\n\r\nYou would want to say it is straightforward to operate the ride, so it is less likely that the defendant made a mistake. \r\n\r\nDon't interrupt the attorney - and don't correct some mistakes counsel made. It sounds very bad-faithed.	It appears you are reading off a script. You don't need it. Your tone is otherwise very natural - I also like the interaction with your witness. Use full screen when you screen share a demonstrative. I would highlight the specific portions of Exhibit 11b as you talk about the content. I like damaging control the mistake Issacs made in the past, but I don't think you should elaborate it any further because it grabs too much attention. Actually, I like using this to show Bowman's knowledge. "anything strange" is way too weird - it breaks the fourth wall as it is weird that the witness just so happens to know what happened. Very good job letting the witness to tell the story.\r\n\r\nWhen D says "your answer is definitely a yes", object counsel testifying. Good hearsay objection. "no one knows where kamron poole is" calls for speculation,. You eventually objected but it is a little untimely.	I like your signposting before you started to question. Don't start every question with an "and". I like using Exhibit 11b - it looks very responsive - idk if it is planned or improvised. You are reading off a script, which makes your presentation less convincing. Control the witness when he wiggles - you controlled on some questions, but you let the witness go on some questions. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't directly interrupt the witness - try to control first, if you have to interrupt, object non-responsive.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that you are suggesting Poole and Longstreet had some collusion, but you never mentioned this in your opening statement, so I wasn't totally prepared for this theory. \r\n\r\nGood job rephrasing your questions after I sustained an objection, but try to write your script so that they do not call for speculation.	9	7	9	7	Appropriate demeanor as a witness. I think it is more natural to sit as a witness. Very natural tone and believable as a witness.	Don't fight on bias pocket - the more you fight, the more biased you sound. Pick your battles. You don't have to fight on every single point, pick your battles.	Good flow of the direct. I think your chemistry with the witness is a little weak tho - see if you can use your tone and voice to sound more interactive. I like the demonstrative in general, it is very clear, but it also shows how little data you have, so it is a trade off. LOLLLLL I am a CS major and took classes in machine learning - what you said is not machine learning - but I won't penalize for this, good effort!	I think you could make a 702b objection to the demonstrative. There are literally just 3 data points and it is weird the witness can make such a definitive conclusion. \r\n\r\nYou need to speak louder - also, your voice sounds a little mumbled perhaps because of your microphone - see if you can do anything about this for the next round. Good response to objection, just sound more confident. You have good questions for your cross, just go off script, speak up, and sound more confident. Don't panic when you were asked to reask the question.	9	7	6	6	Very likable character from the first response. Not a fan of blurred background - it breaks the fourth wall and reminds the judge you are acting instead of being the real person. "I realize something suspicious is happening in the ticket booth" this pending answer is weird - breaks the fourth wall. Your character is well maintained throughout the direct. Good adjustment when time is called.	Don't ask counsel questions, just answer the question - and don't argue with the witness. You don't have any stake in this case, it is weird that you are extremely cooperative for P counsel but fighting this much for D.	Turn on your camera when you are speaking to the judge. Don't read from your script - it makes your interaction with the witness less dynamic. Don't interrupt your witness, it's ok to take a little pause in between answers. Good stroy telling nonetheless. When you signpost (e.g., I want to talk about the two things one at a time), slow down because you want the jury to remember that very clearly.  Good adjustment when the time is limited.\r\n\r\nGood hearsay argument, just direct your arguments to the judge instead of the opposing counsel. I would reraise the objection - I don't think the foundation is sufficient.	I would object 404 to Bowman's character of untruthfulness. Good hearsay objection, but be prepared to respond to opposing counsel's arguments. \r\n\r\nVary in your tone and voice. I wouldn't use a virtual background. I think this witness gives you a hard time but you handled pretty well - good control over all. Use more SIGNPOSTS, telling the jury where you are going next. I don't think the witness gave "Bowman said this" out in direct, so make sure to not bring it up on cross.	6	5	5	9	You were initially monotone, but you sound more natural later on. It's good you sound confused when you talk about how you were accused. You lost some energy after objections.	You are over explaining on cross - it tends to diminish your credibility. Just admit to the bad facts. I won't ask the counsel to repeat the last question when she already asks the next question.	I would have a more sympathetic tone for this witness. Good storytelling in general. No need to interrupt your witness - it's ok to take some pauses. Good job getting the lying ahead and damage control - the direct feels long tho.	Good speculation objections. Very good hearsay arguments, but I eventually overruled because Bowman's actions are what's in contention in today's case. \r\n\r\nGood signpost. I appreciate your use of hand gesture, but only use it to emphasize a point. You can work on your tone and voice to make the points you want to make more dramatic in general. Good witness control. Good use of the demo. I would highlight the specific portion as you speak - it's a little hard to follow when there are so many graphics and numbers on the screen - but your point is very very strong. There are a good portion of the questions that you ended with "correct" - vary it up.\r\n\r\nThis cross feels very long. You brought many good points, but try to select two to three central ideas you want to develop and focus on those. Usually shorter crosses score better.	6	7	7	7	You have good energy, but you have to move your eyes away from your script.	You are mostly cooperative on cross, which is great, but you did lose some energy.	"anything else you want to add" is too vague, it is weird the witness knows what to answer. You sneaked in a leading question - you weren't objected, but I would avoid leading questions all together.  Good job having a short direct.	"I never saw Bowman did anything dishonest" could be 404 given D didn't give you notice in captain's meeting?\r\n\r\nGood, short cross. I would use more signposting. And good control of the witness. You know the material well enough - don't read off a script.	9	7	5	10	Very likable character. Very good hand gestures. Unfortunately, it seems some of your responses are directly taken from the affidavit - people don't speak in the way they write in affidavit. Good emotions buildup.	You were a little caught off guard when D counsel starts to question into your expertise. Be prepared!! Your character also dropped a bit - you were in general over explaining after the method pocket. You were almost crying on direct, it is very weird that you recovered in full so quickly.	Good job coming back after objections - but I would make sure your script is written in a way that does not have any foundational issues. It sounds you are a little unfamiliar with the material - make sure you do, and try not to read off a script. Good response to 702 objection. It is unclear, though, how this direct is helping your case because it is just reaffirming what P case already presented.	Good lof objection. I think asking the witness the amount lost in the revenue is getting very close to improper opinion. You eventually objected, but it could have come a little earlier. You eventually brought this up on cross, but you could argue under 702, not sufficient data/method has been testified for this witness to give a conclusion. "I wonder say Bowman is involved" - there is zero foundation laid as to how she knows that. I would definitely object. \r\n\r\nWOW, I love the responsiveness! You adapted very well given P tendered her as an expert. I would be careful asking open ended questions, though. You know the material very well, don't read from your script. Great witness control. "Move on" is not an effective signpost - it suggests to the jury that your previous section is not important. Instead, just tell the jury where you are going - "I wanna talk about the wristbands you found".	8	Good attempt to use the space. Don't hold your hands up the entire time - I know it feels uncomfortable to put your hands on your side, but it looks more natural that way. Clear summary of the burden of proof. Very very good arguments and summary of evidence throughout your closing. I wonder if you can bring up some demos that occur in case in chief, for example, the very very damning map. \r\n\r\nNo need to repeat the theme at the start of the rebuttal. Don't panic in rebuttal. SLOW DOWN. I would try to make your rebuttal more punchy - you can even have a semi-scripted one.	8	Good tone. Good storytelling. Good job using your voice to emphasize the point. Good job humanizing your client. DON'T READ OFF A SCRIPT. Great use of theme throughout your closing. Nice argument that the most evidence P presents is for how guilty Poole is, but not for Bowman. Take more pauses in between each section. Good job pointing out the problem of State's case.	51	37	128	135	129	68	75	127	130	131	t
194	7	- What evidence connects, truth reveals\r\n- Good job being specific about what relationship Whit and Poole have\r\n- When going through the three elements, I could tell you were using a 1, 2, 3, hand gesture, but it was off camera. Bring your hand up to make the 1, 2, 3 easier to see\r\n- I like the question you ask during the detective's witness explanation\r\n- Good pause... 'one person... Whit Bowman' I think the pause could even be slightly longer\r\n- Try varying your speed, maybe going a little bit slower at times to highlight points. You're staying at the same speed	8	- 3 actors, one scapegoat, and one victim\r\n- Struck a deal - good hand gesture\r\n- Tax evasion theory\r\n- Good emphasis on burden\r\n- It doesn't look like you have your script up, but your eyes aren't on the camera and it's making you look like you're reading or looking at your video. Keep your eyes on the camera\r\n- Good job varying your volume, loud and soft \r\n- Good job using 'you will hear'\r\n- Bumped into the control panel when the shot went off\r\n- Good hand gestures	7	8	8	9	- Go slower when describing the officer being hit, given that he's now comatose (pretty emotionally heavy and you want to pull on the jury's heartstrings)\r\n- Good command of the content, feels like you lived through what you're talking about\r\n- Very strong punctuation on certain words\r\n- make eye contact with the camera	- Good job maintaining credibility by giving direct responses\r\n- Brainstorm responses to those initial questions about not seeing Poole selling false bands\r\n- Good emotion with your father passing away\r\n- Why hired Q 'In part, yes' <-- good  job not folding	- Good questioning\r\n- Confident objection response, objection was overruled so make sure you re-ask the question\r\n- Go through and make sure you know how the witness satisfied rules 702a-d\r\n- good job letting the witness have the spotlight\r\n---\r\n- Good job making an objection on CX, I think you were in the neighborhood about it actually being for the TMA, but I needed a stronger argument	- Good objection to improper opinion\r\n- Good follow-up lack of foundation objection to point out that there might not be anyone in the shadow, I hope you bring it up on CX\r\n- Speculation is testifying to a mindset\r\n- Good 702 objection, your confidence stating that looking at something isn't enough to satisfy a method was compelling\r\n- Try a different objection, at this point, after I've said the method was sufficient to for Det. Kimball to make a conclusion, improper opinion attacking the method won't fly\r\n- I think the improper opinion objection was interesting, but I don't think it was a direct element of the crime. I think it could have been a speculation objection as the witness was testifying that WB was intending to lie\r\n---\r\n- Start was clear tight questioning\r\n- Don't cut off the witness\r\n- Good 'I'm not asking X, I'm asking Y'\r\n- Be more sensitive when asking Det. K about his father's death\r\n- 'Not what I think, what you think' vibe -- I liked it, but it was on the border for me, I felt the 'you could say that' is colloquially the same	6	7	5	8	- I like the outfit, but I wish you were a bit further from the camera so that I could see the vest, all I see is the top of your shoulders\r\n- I like the exasperated emotion you're bringing to this character, it feels genuine and what the owner would feel\r\n- When Kimbell pulls out his gun, make that a bigger deal, this whole deal is a really big deal! make me realize that with your tone\r\n- Give some speed changes and pauses to vary your presentation	- Staff work minimum wage - 'yeah but it's legal' (find a better response, of course it's legal, but it makes you look cheap)\r\n- You cut corners - Yes (Don't just agree to that! Sounds really bad)\r\n-	- Check your camera angle, your eyes are cut off\r\n- Argued subsequent action but didn't clearly state what that subsequent action was \r\n- Second hearsay 'I would fire him' SA was definitely there, and laid the foundation after objection was overruled\r\n- 403 - don't ask to rephrase, fight that objection\r\n----\r\n- I'd consider objecting to Tax evasion, especially bc you haven't made one yet	- Great hearsay objection and great job moving to strike! I haven't heard anyone else do that yet\r\n- Good 403 objection\r\n---\r\n- Witness doesn't have to give just a yes or a no, I wouldn't recommend asking this\r\n- Friends in high places, good hand gesture\r\n- Really impressed with how clear this cross is, slow, direct questions (very good)\r\n- Good Q format (you X.... You X because Y)	6	6	5	7	- Casual, laid back\r\n- First answer was a little long\r\n- I like the character, but I think you could give a little bit more energy or mix it up just a little bit to keep the questions from blending into eachother and highlighting the important points\r\n- I like the outfit for this character	- Starting off the cross a little difficult, I'd consider being a bit more friendly to start it off\r\n- Doing well being non-confrontational, answering the question \r\n- Good response 'yeah they sat in the back'	- Lower your camera angle a little bit, top quarter of your screen is empty\r\n- Great hearsay response 'Questions don't assert a truth\r\n- Hearsay 'I don't need anyone to take over' is not hearsay, using it to show subsequent action! Fight on that, don't offer to rephrase\r\n- Keep looking at the camera, it looks like you're writing something\r\n- Ran over on time and final q&a was longer than 15 seconds\r\n- Good co-conspirator response\r\n- Said one more Q and tried to do 2\r\n-	- I wouldn't object to narrative, but good job breaking up the testimony\r\n- Good hearsay objection, watch your body language (obvious nodding) it's not professional (though I tend to do it too)\r\n----\r\n- Don't interrupt the witness\r\n- Despite saying easy to operate, you made a mistake <-- I like this Q\r\n- Good follow up with 'not under stress'\r\n- Peered means a few seconds of look - awkward phrasing\r\n- I'm having trouble with how the knife fits into the equation\r\n- Good tone on sit by the back\r\n- Improper impeachment - move on! He didn't see how the bag was handed off, he	8	8	7	6	- I love the charisma! \r\n- Hidden truth and secrets at Rochterworld -- love it!\r\n- Good job getting out that it was easy to bump the button\r\n- When describing the two books, use your tone to convey that it was some big secret (lean in close, really get the jury's attention)	- Good job keeping up the character\r\n- Leaning a little bit close to the camera to hear, but your head is filling up the screen, uncomfortable\r\n- Great job being non-confrontational	- Make sure that your team is on time, even if there are technical issues, let me know! Don't leave me in the dark\r\n- I'd love to see the board, you're describing it, show it to me!\r\n- Have the powerpoint in presentation mode before screensharing, great job using a demo!\r\n---\r\n- Relevance is a weak objection, find something better!	- Good lack of foundation objection\r\n- Longstreet was the problem" (improper opinion)\r\n----\r\n- "ask Q's to get your credibility" <-- little awk \r\n- Are you reading? keep looking down\r\n- Starting every question with 'So'	8	9	8	6	- Love the 'addressing the sexism' you go girl\r\n- Good character with the $300 is 8 days at rochterworld!\r\n- Burst a blood vessel - good character moment\r\n- Make sure you vary your response if you're re-asked the question	- Good job asking clarifying questions, asking the attorney to rephrase the question\r\n- No, 9pm.... good job making Liu rephrase\r\n- 'We were going to get caught' very realistic repeating what you heard back to see if the attorney's question was right	- Make sure to ask to proceed\r\n- Good 'provide some context'\r\n- Said 'nice' after answer, cut that side commentary - I like the 'angry, shocked,' looping\r\n- Cut off the witness to say thank you before she was done answering -- pause before asking the next question\r\n- Good relevance objection, I overruled thinking I would see where it was going but I didn't see it	- Good job making a hearsay objection, good response -- seeing would paint a better picture than just hearing\r\n----\r\n-Overruled the relevance objection thinking that I would see the relevance in the following question, but I didn't see it. Why was it relevant?\r\n- Good storytelling, leading the jury through what happened\r\n- 9pm v 8pm, know the affidavit\r\n- Use your vocal variation to really stress what was important about the call	9	8	9	8	- I like the kind, soft portrayal of this witness\r\n- Shamefully, I did nothing.... great performance here\r\n- Great story telling, really locked in to this	- Loosing a little bit of that soft touch that you had on direct\r\n- Why did you delete texts?\r\n- Lot of bad points, good job downplaying them\r\n- Changed your story on the Issacs point	- Good job 'let the record reflect'\r\n- Saw the hand too early, be sure that doesn't come out til you're ready\r\n- Great tone\r\n- Hand looked comically large. I like the demonstrative but it looked misleading\r\n---\r\n- Good ICE objection\r\n- Don't shake your head like that, giving the witness the answer	- Relevance on the second question -- it's just background, establishing who the witness is\r\n- 'Billie Issac asked me to operate'\r\n- That hand is NOT normal size haha, definitely object to misleading the jury\r\n- Good objection to 403\r\n----\r\n- Good clear questioning\r\n- ICE to ring toss - said you were using it to establish relationship but that can be done without the ring toss game\r\n- Please don't cut off the witness\r\n- Great tight questions and locking down the witness	8	- Involved in every key moment of the crime, not an accident, but part of the crime \r\n- Good catch on the 'offered to take over ToT, words are inconsistent with herself'\r\n- Try to change the camera angle to allow for hand gestures\r\n- Good argument for 'why would Poole run through the park'?\r\n- Saw all of the slides, work on that presentation\r\n- Really good demos, love what you've got here\r\n- Put quotes around 'Call me NOW,' looks kinda random rn	8	- Fingers going into the camera make them look big and kinda cool\r\n- I don't like the theme, it's not memorable\r\n- Hand gestures are being cut off by the camera\r\n- Good three points\r\n- It was her friend, Kimbell, not the police \r\n- 'Something is Missing' <-- sounds like the AMTA finals \r\n- I want you to remember this moment, was Longstreet convicted, 'yes' *pause* --> could have hit that harder\r\n- If there was never a robbery, why did poole pay the driver $400?	48	151	99	105	101	66	100	104	103	63	t
185	7	--good structure\r\n--good delivery\r\n--you don't need to say that's all in the end	8	--the storytelling is good\r\n--good delivery, good pace\r\n--you don't need to apologize	7	6	6	7	--good hand gesture\r\n--you made your points very clear and easy to understand	--you can explain or argue a bit more	--Breakdown your questions\r\n--good flow	--your questions are short and effective\r\n--you can be more fluent\r\n--be more confident when you cross\r\n--this is a long cross	7	6	5	5	--the storytelling can be more engaging\r\n--good flow of questions	--you can explain a bit more\r\n--you made some smart responses	--good establishment of expert experience\r\n--you need to let your witness establish that this is "conducted regularly"\r\n--the judge just let you lay that hearsay foundation, which you ignore. Be more familiar with ROE\r\n--credibility of the witness is ALWAYS relevant to the case\r\n--you should know the "father" part is trying to prove witness's bias	--don't give up your objection battle. There is no enough foundation laid for regularly conducted activity. \r\n--The hearsay objection is sustained, but the witness keeps testifying? object\r\n--you just need to say "credibility is relevant" + "if I can make a matter of proof" to the relevance objection	5	7	6	5	--you can have more character\r\n--don't put everything in the direct.

289	7	Theme: They came for the money, they came for the life.\r\nGood explanation with the legal elements.\r\nBetter if you could refer more back to the theme.	7	Theme: He was made the scapegoat.\r\nGreat presentation. \r\nNeed to cut the story shorter, and address a little more about the witnesses.\r\nGood that you keep referring back to the theme.	7	6	6	6	It is a little unnatural that the witness stops after the second group of relevant personnel. If you don't want the answers to be too long, maybe just ask about the personnel one by one.	Great job with the yes sandwich structure. But if every answer is like that, it is also a little weird lol. \r\nYou got a little bit angry towards the end with the impeachment.	Great demo and neat structure. \r\nI don't think quoting the relevant personnel one my one is a clear structure for the direct. The information is rather scattered, but as the first witness of the case, it is crucial that you tell the jury what happened exactly. But it doesn't seem to me that the story is well told.	Missed hearsay objections. \r\nIt is okay to give the witness some leeway to briefly explain. Otherwise, it just makes you look a little too pushy.\r\nBe careful not to take too long during the impeachment. It might not be worth it. Especially if you spend a few minutes looking for the affidavit.	8	7	8	6	Really nice character and acting. I enjoyed it.	Good that you are maintaining your character.	Good structure. \r\nThe ending is strong. The foundations are solid and the explanations are strong. \r\nThe objection ground is "relevance", not "irrelevance".\r\nBe careful with relevance objections because it offers the opposing counsel an opportunity to explain explicitly what she is trying to infer through the questions. And plus, relevance has a rather low bar.\r\nGood try with the improper character evidence objection, but the character evidence form doesn't really work this way. It asks us to clarify the character evidence that we hope to offer, but doesn't put a limit to the exceptions of offering prior wrongs and acts.	For the relevance objection, you can just say that it goes to the credibility of the witness.\r\nTry not to end the cross with an objection.	8	6	7	6	Interesting background and good acting.\r\nA new cup of drink magically appeared in cross after you crushed the previous one hahaha.	Good responses.	Good foundations.	Missed hearsay objections.\r\nQuestions do not have truth value and therefore are not considered hearsay. \r\nNeed more foundations between questions. Break down the questions. Short and concise questions are better.	7	6	7	6	Great character and acting!	A little too fighty sometimes.	The questions could benefit from more foundations and smoother transitions.	Missed hearsay & lack of personal knowledge objections.\r\nDon't keep asking "is it a yes" when the witness is explicitly saying "yes"	7	7	7	8	The conversation sounds really natural.	Good maintaining the character	Try avoid asking questions like "Did anything special happen?".	Very strong first question. And very clear questions.	7	6	7	7	Natural acting. Sounds sincere.	Good responses.	Great foundations. It would be even clearer if you could add some sign-posting before changing the topic.	Remember to address the judge during objection battles.\r\nGood questions.	9	They came for the money, and they came for the life.\r\nGood story-telling at the beginning.\r\nYou did a good job telling the story, explaining the legal elements, and gathering the evidence. It's good that you kept referring back to testimonies heard earlier in the trial.\r\nGreat rebuttal	7	Good explaining the burden of proof.\r\nNeed to keep referring back to your theme, which is a strong theme in my opinion. \r\nFrom my perspective, at least before closing, your case theory is that Longstreet and Floyd were actually the true criminals. You need to try to mention to that narrative right from the beginning.	72	164	57	59	178	175	60	58	177	176	t
297	9	- "good day" is an elegant way of getting around the time zone differences\r\n- excellent zoom eye contact\r\n- "he turned off the lights he hides all his lies"\r\n- you do a great job setting the scene/painting a picture at the beginning, but you can avoid names like "officer roberts" - they jar me out of the moment\r\n- in general throughout the opening you can avoid every name except the defendant's and maaaaybe one other (victim or accomplice probably). instead, identify them by their role - the police officer, a ride operator, etc\r\n- i really liked the "we don't have to prove he was the one holding the knife/taking the money" bit\r\n- you have a fantastic tone on the burden section\r\n- i generally don't love the 3 witness structure. it doesn't flow as well as structuring by points/arguments\r\n- near the end of this opening you get a little too in-the-weeds/detailed, but otherwise it's really strong overall\r\n- your tone on the "hold them accountable" bit is also really compelling\r\n- watch the timing	6	- "the real defendant isn't here"\r\n- i like your theme and theory a lot but you can do more with the delivery to make this feel more like a defense opening. part of that is in pauses - i want longer pauses between sections and after times you say your theme\r\n- you picked a good spot to introduce cameron poole's name\r\n- same comments as to P opening about not structuring by "3 witnesses" and not using people's names when you don't have to\r\n- nicely timed\r\n- if you say "thank you" at the end of your statement it makes the ending feel more controlled/planned	7	8	8	6	- i love your enthusiasm on this character\r\n- there are places your jokes/character lines come out sounding a little scripted - if you can loosen up the delivery it'll feel more natural\r\n- the line about matching outfits to wristbands was great, a good way to highlight an important fact while letting character shine\r\n- i also liked the different kinds of scream answer even though it's totally objectionable	- i liked you even more on cross. i thought you felt more natural and you did a really nice job staying in character\r\n- good modulation of how much to fight and ways to fight while seeming helpful\r\n- sometimes you say "that is correct" which is probably when you feel the least like your character on direct - probably phrases like "that's right" or "yep, exactly" are gonna work better for you	- great job sounding interested in the answers to your questions\r\n- you also do some very solid facial acting/expressions to go along with your attorneying that make you really likeable\r\n- well handled on the technical difficulties\r\n- there are places the structure of this direct feels forced, where it doesn't follow the intuitive flow of the story and feels more like just reciting important facts.\r\n- i would have loved if the end of the direct had tied more tightly to bowman rather than to poole, that plays into their theme a little bit\r\n- "so long as they share the right exhibit" sounded snarky\r\n- i liked that spec objection	- i think you absolutely could have objected to the witness somehow being able to tell what kind of scream they heard\r\n- i didn't fully follow the point you were making with exhibit 7 - i think if you had a few more headers/signposts, that could have made your point clearer\r\n- about tone for cross examination: the most useful advice i've ever heard is that on cross, you're not asking questions, you're making statements and demanding that the witness agree with you. you don't have to raise the tone of your voice at the end of each question (and it will make it feel more confident if you don't).\r\n- after you win the objection make sure to reask the question\r\n- you're making good points, they're just a little hard to follow without enough tone variation and headers\r\n- nice clean hearsay response	8	7	7	7	- fantastic confidence and eye contact throughout the direct\r\n- i normally like when cops/experts call their attorneys "ma'am" or "sir" but i also really loved how you called her "Ms. Lu"\r\n- for the question "and whose smartphone was this", i wanted you to answer more straightforwardly with "Whit Bowman's." and then go on to explain how bowman denied and then admitted it\r\n- more generally, there are places you could have been more concise to make the points more punchy	- "the evidence simply doesn't indicate the possibility" is a good line\r\n- you don't have to drop contractions - phrases like "that is true" or "that is correct" rather than "that's true" make you feel more scripted/less real\r\n- you started speeding up as the cross went on. one of the best things you can do as a witness on cross is pause for a second before answering. it breaks up their flow and brings attention back to you.	- well-structured and you had a good balance of coming across confident and fading into the background to allow your witness to shine\r\n- both of you could use slightly more pauses, especially between sections\r\n- careful not to sound panicked if you feel like you're losing an objection	- even if you don't have any objections to an exhibit, you can win points by super confidently and unhesitatingly saying "no objections, your honor"\r\n- nice hearsay objection\r\n- the very last conclusion on direct was way too far in my opinion and i think you could have objected.\r\n- as this cross went along you picked up some momentum which i really liked\r\n- i liked the "so it took you about three minutes to conclude bowman had to be arrested" point, and the delivery of it was excellent\r\n- this went on a little too long	8	8	8	9	- i love the costuming and background choices\r\n- some of your responses felt super natural and believable, like how you asked "the entire time?" in clarification after a question. good job!\r\n- it feels a little odd that you call bowman by last name only when you worked with him. I would probably have this witness call him "Whit"\r\n- the "shut up" joke was funny	- nice job using "good morning" to interrupt flow\r\n- i like the "as a matter of fact yeah she fired me"\r\n- you can pick some questions to fight less on or just give a couple-word answer, it will allow you more latitude to fight on the points you care about.\r\n- careful not to echo the question they asked every single time, a few times is effective but too many starts to feel like you're stalling	- good job rolling with the technical difficulties\r\n- i like calling her "ma'am"\r\n- phrases like "to the best of of your recollection" are more formal than you need and make you feel less real. you could probably say something like "from what you remember" instead\r\n- good clarification on the hearsay obj\r\n- i like the redirect choice	- you've got a great tone and a good sense of how to emphasize which of your questions are bit points\r\n- fantastic little laugh on the "we don't care if it will really work out just fine"\r\n- but you made both a "not hearsay" and a "hearsay exception" argument at once, just pick one\r\n- good looping of her words, "not only did they look similar but they had the same height"\r\n- on the relevance of the other ride argument, it would be helpful for you to proffer the relevance so the judge knows where you're going\r\n- this also was a bit longer than it needed to be. often short concise crosses can be the most punchy\r\n- i like the sequence about "was anyone running/was anyone holding a gun"	7	6	6	9	- you feel relatively like a real person, which is great, but i worry about believability/likeability with how your script is written. the character is a little unlikeable\r\n- when you're creating a character, make sure you consider whether your character is a "person" or a "premise". The whole "big fan of Jackie Kennedy" thing is a premise, it's not a fully fleshed out 3D character. i would try to add some more nuance/layers to it\r\n- good job rolling after objections	- be careful not to sound bored/exasperated on this cross. your attorney is coming across very calm and likeable so if you react you look petty\r\n- but good job not being too fighty\r\n- and you felt like a real person on cross too, but you lost a little more likeability\r\n- this got lower energy as it went along	- you're sounding a little bit scripted on your questioning. one easy change is to pause a little longer after each answer to ask your next question\r\n- i would cut any unnecessary names like "floyd" from this direct- names are confusing for juries	- i like your tone on objections a bunch, you sound serious but also not too aggressive/confrontational\r\n- your baseline tone on cross is nice too. and you do a good job smiling / being kind to a lay witness\r\n- great signposts/headers!\r\n- good looping for witness control at the end of the cross\r\n- and i liked the length, way to keep it short and sharp	9	8	8	7	- "voted most likely to end up in court" was hilarious\r\n- overall i love how much you committed to this character, you really brought the energy of the trial up\r\n- also the body language of this character is great\r\n- good job emphasizing the big points and catching my attention	- you lost some of your character on cross\r\n- good job not fighting too much\r\n- i think you could benefit a lot from a few scripted/planned cross jokes that you can use every time	- good job playing off the witness's character but you could pause longer after his answers to let them sink in\r\n- you overacted "do you mean when he was talking on the phone you were listening" a little bit - you don't have to be shocked by that\r\n- i want a sequence of questions like "did you see whit bowman" "did you ever hear bowman's name" etc\r\n- if you ask to proffer you have to wait for the judge to give you permission before you actually do	- great hearsay obj\r\n- i want a little more tone variation between questions but you do a really nice job emphasizing some of the big lines. how you said "we're going to get caught" was really compelling\r\n- can you have more headers/signposts?	9	7	6	8	- you have a fantastic voice and you feel very real\r\n- the shirt is a bold choice for a defendant but a great touch - oh i was just informed that witnesses aren't expected to wear formal attire at this tournament. in that case it's great all around!\r\n- you did a wonderful emotion ramp up for the dramatic part of the direct\r\n- you can pause a little bit longer before answering questions	- i stopped believing you as much on the first "lied" point\r\n- careful not to sound impatient with the questioning, especially as the defendant\r\n- you're occasionally repeating the same lines to the "you lied" questions, which makes them sound much more like canned responses\r\n- sometimes you're talking in sentence fragments, which makes you sound terse	- the structure of this direct is solid but your defendant feels really guilty. i would love some more questions like "were you involved with ____" or "did you know ____" besides the ones you already have\r\n- if you can sound more interested in the witness answers it will help, especially since he's your client.	- i liked your hearsay obj and disagreed with the presider\r\n- great witness control on "i'm not asking how you felt at that moment"\r\n- you have headers, but you could do more to make your headers tell me what the point is rather than just what the topic is\r\n- at some point earlier you need to either impeach him or move on rather than continuing to try to make him agree to "set up his plan"\r\n- yeah i don't think you won that impeachment sorry	8	- you're very composed but to step up to the next level i want you to loosen up a little. you have a baseline "lawyer pose" with your hands in front of you - if you can instead have your hands relaxed at your sides you'll be more natural\r\n- you have a really nice storytelling tone\r\n- i want moments for this to get more aggressive. It's a prosecution closing, it can be flashier and angrier\r\n- especially on the big dramatic quotes\r\n- you do some tone variation, can you add speed variation? moments where you build up momentum and then pause to let a point sink in, etc\r\n- you have a good smile when you're talking about the absurdity of a D point	8	- your theme is great for your theory\r\n- i don't love using air quotes in the close, i would just imply the air quotes with tone\r\n- you have a good tone for D close, especially for talking about reasonable doubt\r\n- good job varying tone and conveying incredulousness\r\n- you have a talent for going quiet to emphasize points, it's a hard skill to master\r\n- similar to P close, I want a couple more moments of big ramp-up	77	176	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t
287	5	Turn on your camera when speaking to the judges. \r\n\r\nOpening: good job standing up. It appears you are looking to your right from time to time - it suggests you are reading off a script. Vary your tone. Good story telling. I think you can change the content of the speech so the structure feels more natural. Good appeal for verdict - it feels a little forced tho.	7	Give the judge a chance to respond once you said an item. \r\n\r\n"Blinded by the need to blame" is a classic theme. Very interesting case theory - I wonder if your theme could better reflect your theory.  Good tone. Try to vary it tho. Your story section is a little long, and argumentative, and when you move to the burden section I think you've lost some attention unfortunately.	7	8	9	6	Very likable character starting from the first witness. I think you can be more realistic by having a backstory. Love the costume. "things got a little bit different this year" this pending answer is very weird and breaks the fourth wall. Your character faded a little later on in the direct.	You said no to some questions and got away - I think they might be in your affidavit - if that's the case, you need to be careful. You are mostly agreeable on cross examination, which is great. Knowing D's theory of accusing you participating in the alleged robbery, your demeanor is great.	Good flow of the direct. Good, inquiry tone.  Good structure of the direct. I think some of the questions could be more natural and interactive. Some of the answers are also too long.	I think there are a couple of LOF objections you missed.\r\n\r\nI would highlight specific portion as you talk about the employee manual. If the witness disagrees with you, you need to control him. You have good, assertive, tone, but vary it up when you want to make a point. Fair response to LOF objection. I like using the map to demonstrate the relevant distance. But try to highlight specific section as you talk about it. Good job rephrasing after I sustained the objection. Don't end with an objection.	5	5	7	9	You sound a little nervous - that's okay, be confident, you are the expert! It appears you are reading as well. I like the demo. Good adjustment given the technical issue.	You sound more natural once you are off script. Good job not fighting too much on bias. Try to avoid impeachment - it tends to diminish your credibility. You lost some confidence after the impeachment - remain confident! There are definitely questions that are one question too far. Be brave to disagree.	I understand you might have to adjust because of technical difficulty, but I wouldn't sit on a couch as an attorney as it can come across as unprofessional. You have good contents, just make sure you sound confident and not reading off a script. I don't think Exhibit 7 is in evidence yet. You need to enter it first before referring to its content. I think the rule you are referring to is Rule 703.\r\n\r\nDon't withdraw your objection, it tends to make you seem less confident.	Fair argument for 702. I would like to believe it is an honest mistake, but try not to interrupt opposing counsel during her argument. I don't think Exhibit 7 is in evidence yet, so you should object when they start to refer to its contents. Very good argument under 703.\r\n\r\nGood control of the witness. I think you need to lay the foundation how Kimball knew Longstreet knew. Fairly clean impeachment. Don't ask the final question tho, just move on. I like pointing out the two possibilities - it goes to your case theory that Haley Floyd is involved in the crime.\r\n\r\nThis cross felt a little long. After the second pocket landed pretty well and first pocket had a clean impeachment, I would end the cross right there. \r\n\r\nI love the pocket about the charges against Bowman. I never heard it before and it sounds really strong especially when your theory focus on how biased this detective is.	8	8	6	8	Love your try for accent - if that's intentional! I don't know if this is intentional, but I like that you took a moment to remember some facts - it makes your depiction more realistic.	You remain mostly likable during the cross - great job!! I think you could have fought a little bit more - even though there's nothing much you could have done, the questions are pretty confined. But you remain very credible, which is great.	Call the witness by their last name - Ms. Issacs, not Ms. Billy. An easy response to hearsay objection is that it is admission by party opponent. Some of the answers are way too long. Break it down.	I wouldn't object hearsay to statements made by the defendant, because of 801d2. \r\n\r\nGreat response to relevance. It appears you are reading off a script, unfortunately. LOVE The focus of Longstreet in your cross. It goes directly to your theory. I would try to use more signposting in general to tell the jury where you are going.	10	10	9	5	I don't know if it is planned or not, but I love the fact you "accidentally" interrupted the witness. Your character is very very likable. Love the costume. It adds to your credibility when you speak highly of Floyd, given D is accusing him of participating. You maintained your character well during objections, which is very rare and great.	You maintained your character very well on cross. Great job.	Great interaction with the witness. Great job fading to the background and let your witness being the star. Like the use of Exhibit 11. SLOW DOWN when you signpost - it is much more efficient and sticky to the witness' mind when you speak slowly. I would have a more friendly demeanor (aka smile) to match the energy of your witness. \r\n\r\nThe long pause after the witness said she was fired is SO EFFECTIVE. This direct feels a little long, perhaps because there are a little too much good facts brought up.\r\n\r\n"Does everyone know the exit behind tunnel of terror" - speculation?	"why are you fired" should be speculation. "Haley is mad" is also speculation.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, don't ask open-ended questions on cross. It is unclear why you started your cross with two open-ended questions.	9	9	9	5	Like the character a lot. I'm not a big fan of virtual background. I also think driving while testifying in court is illegal. Your passive aggressive tone works surprisingly well for your sentence. I couldn't see clearly - but it appears you are looking at one corner of your screen from time to time - if you are reading, don't, you know your material good enough.	Some of your responses are quite long, but I don't think it hurts your credibility - well done!	Nice flow of direct. I think you could have been more friendly (similar to my comment above) in your demeanor. Take more pauses.\r\n\r\nI think you already mentioned the conversation Poole had on direct - if that's the case, I wouldn't object hearsay, but great job in the lack of personal knowledge objection.	Good attempt to control the witness. It appears you are looking at the side of the screen - I don't know if you are reading off a script, but try to keep eye contact with the witness/judge.	9	8	6	8	It appears you are reading off a script. Generally, I don't like jokes on defendant direct, but I think your character worked really really well. WOW, you participated in the scheme? Interested in how you will spin it. I like how you are still maintaining your accent when you have connection issue.	You dropped the character when you say you don't know where you are from. Just say whatever you are thinking.	I would be more sympathetic in demeanor when you are directing the defendant.  Are you pleading guilty to theft by deception? The witness just admitted she participated in the scheme. That's a really big issue.\r\n\r\nI like the flow of the direct otherwise. It feels a little too long.	Nice objection on improper opinion. I would reraise the objection, I think the way she reraised the question still calls for speculation. \r\n\r\nChatting with the witness works surprisingly well given she is very likable. This witness just admitted something REALLY bad that she is participating in the scheme, I would try to adjust your comments so that it hits hard.	7	It appears you are reading at some points. Love your passion. Good story telling in general. I would try to vary up your tone more. Good summary of evidence. I would use up the space more.\r\n\r\nI would use the same speed and tone in rebuttal. Don't panic.	9	LOVE THE START. Very very strong. I would try to make more use of the space. I think you can vary your speed and tone a little more, but very good storytelling overall. Your burden came a little too late. But very good explanation of the burden of proof. Good argument in the case. But I think the closing in general is a little too dry.	74	37	221	218	222	219	220	212	214	227	t

(mistake, friendship...) i think i heard something being mentioned a couple of times but i'm not sure if it's the theme. i would bring it up upfront\r\n- used knife to threaten the accountant --> that's not what the P is arguing and they didn't mention it at all in the opening stmt, so why volunteer this bad fact?\r\n- a bit argumentative here and there. not supposed to argue in open\r\n- explain charges and bop before witness intro. you should emphasize P's high burden in opening and explain a bit what beyond a reasonable doubt mean\r\n- good to ask 3 facts but you could also screenshare a demo to make it clearer. reason(?) motive action --> i had the impression that the first two have overlap?\r\n- good delivery\r\n- didn't get the flower analogy?	7	6	8	7	- good speed and easy to listen to \r\n- the method is interviewing witnesses?

could make it clearer to the jury that there's nothing but interviewing witness on 702c. could even do a voir dire too in this case\r\n- P has not broughout up anything about Count2, why ask about threatening Floyd?\r\n- re-ask the question every time after the objection don't move on\r\n- never say "last question". in fact, that wasn't your last question because you asked another one trying to control the witness	9	9	8	8	nb啊傅亿航\r\n- great character 迪士尼儿xs\r\n- 喝茶植入太刻意了lol 但你的精彩表演被screenshare挡住了\r\n- great emphasis on the abnormality re: 8 times vs 1-2\r\n- great job downplaying your bias against longstreet	- blue lever is at a very very low corner --> good and concise response\r\n- not too fighty, had just the right amount of explanation\r\n- good job maintaining character	- great tone but could have more variation when you're switching topics / talking about different things\r\n- great emphasis on the blue lever should never be pushed\r\n- ask cocounsel take down demo as soon as it's no longer used	- adjust lighting 脸有点曝光过度\r\n- use clearer signposting. tell us what we should expect and look for. organize your cx into ~3 pockets\r\n- have your teammate screenshare exhibit as soon as you mention it\r\n- not the world's most robust training is way too good than not even professional --> i would control the wit: it's not even close to robust in fact it's not professional at all, right?\r\n- could have make the point "under the table" stronger	8	7	8	7	- it's tough to do it within 6:30 but 宁可delete questions也不要speed up. you're speaking too fast\r\n- i can see your passion in disney and great job resonate it in Issac's dx\r\n- re cutting questions: It's already established on the record that that someone might be stealing money from ticket booth so you don't really have to repeat that given your time constraint. you should focus more on the details of the blue lever\r\n- eye movement of tracking the script  is obvious	- too defensive don't keep saying "i have answered that already" but you had minimal fight-backs so that was good\r\n- Lost character a bit since you're so agreeable like 迪士尼宣传大使 on dx but a little defensive and stiff/stern on cx	- it's tough to do it within 6:30 but 宁可delete questions也不要speed up. a bit too fast\r\n eg. profit/loss is not really important since Kimball has already mentioned the trend and we don't really need spefics of the trend to establish there's an abnormality. \r\n- good job recovering from 803-6 although quesitons are leading\r\n----\r\n- pick your objections: no need to object to exhibit11 since your witnesses also talked about it	- great objections and arguments\r\n- don't rush don't speed up this was too fast\r\n- use signposting\r\n- control the witness when she keep saying it's before. be like: it's your sworn testimony that you don't .... now?\r\n- why talk about floyd since the state never brought it up? adjust your speeches and exams according to their theory\r\n- have your teammate screenshare and have everything ready for you beforehand so that it goes smoothly	7	7	7	8	- agreeable and likeable\r\n- 1920's rides?! wow\r\n- i think you could have more variation in tone when you're talking about different topics  and use your tone to lay more emphasis on the important facts	- maintained your agreeable personality on cx\r\n- don't fight on unncessary details. definitely no need to fight on every single question. only fight back on the facts that actually hurt your case	- nice inquisitive tone\r\n- good looping in witness's answers in your questions\r\n- this is the first time you found fake bracelet, what about the other two --> let's talk about the other two times one by one. what was the second time? what was the third time?\r\n- could have screenshared the fake bracelets w/o the number to show comparison\r\n- don't end on an objection	- good tone\r\n- don't need to say "correct" at the end of every question\r\n- good questions but you could tighten your flow a bit	6	6	7	9	- seems credible\r\n- pay attention to the objection battle so that you get the cue of what to say and what not to say in the following answer\r\n- good to talk about what the fake bracelets look like through every defense witness but it would be much more powerful if you screenshare the exhibit to visualize it every single time	- don't need fight back on every single detail. you don't know the definition of the word like "proper" and "familiar"?	- very sympathetic tone nice job\r\n- just re-ask the question after objections instead of saying "please finish your answer" just so the witness knows what to say\r\n- i know the objections are frustrating but come across as kinder and nicer to your witness\r\n- this dx is a bit too long. get rid of unnecessary details. eg. no one has mentioned about the knife. keep an eye on the time\r\n-----\r\n- really wouldn't recommend to re-dx. Bowman's explanation is not like sth you'll talk about in closing, and you won't lose the case without that but your teammates score matters. They wouldn't be able to present all they have with only 3:30. read the judge as well.	- strong and aggressive start\r\n- good job adjusting your questioning to witness's answer\r\n- control the witness when she says "i guess...": i'm not asking about your guesses, you know for sure that's a fact, right?\r\n- don't cut off the witness at any time even though it's really long\r\n- good job adjusting your questions to the witness's answer re: i had no intention pressing the red button\r\n- take down exhibit 11b when no longer using\r\n- re "delete any incriminating messages that might get you in jail" "i don't know": you don't know whether you've deleted any messages from your phone??\r\n- this cx feels very long though, could've objected non-responsive	6	6	6	7	- idk if that video was meant for your character but if not make sure you're in a quiet enviornment and nothing pops up\r\n- interesting tone\r\n- it was way too fast so it's a bit hard to follow, sound a bit scripted \r\n- look at the camera	- could have explained more on some bad facts	- only pick and choose most important facts since you're short on time, talked about a lot of unncessary details \r\n- when mentioning the knife and being threatened? no one talked about it in pros case-in-chief --> now you open the door for defense to cross on it	- 笑出框了兄弟lol\r\n- good lines of questioning. good job leveraging the point on the knife	9	- when sth is done 7-8 times it's intentional --> that narrative was good\r\n- could move around a bit when you're talking/moving from points to points\r\n- good structure but i wouldn't pull up demo throughout my speech.\r\n- good job looking at the camera\r\n- i don't think the picture of the bracelet has ever been shown throughout the trial though\r\n- excellent delivery	8	- excellent delivery\r\n- maybe change a more professional shirt?\r\n- great hand gestures\r\n- great energy level and passion and anger for the charge	64	104	148	150	127	149	151	129	152	153	t
268	7	"She knew, she conspired, so she helped" - theme\r\n\r\nGood recounting of the overall story of the trial as well as good definition and explanation of what the prosecution is suing the defendant for. Pretty good pace for the speech, but I would still work a little bit on slowing down. Some parts were quite fast and a bit hard to understand.\r\n\r\nSolid explanation of the evidence that we're going to hear from the prosecution in a very clear manner.	9	Solid pace and solid, firm tone. In addition, I appreciate bringing the defendant on the camera for further sympathy/empathy from the jury (quite accurate to real trials haha). \r\n\r\n"Wrong person, wrong place, wrong time" - pretty good theme! Great anticipation of what the evidence the prosecution may be missing.	8	7	9	7	Quite the personable witness - but witness introductions, as much as I enjoy them, should be kept to a concise length - at risk of a relevance objection from opposing counsel. Very realistic witness with a good bit of humor without making it ridiculous, which is always appreciated in mock trial.	Pretty good answers to the cross questions, not giving the crossing attorney any freebies and asking them to clarify when needed. \r\n\r\nGreat job with maintaining the same demeanor on cross as you did on direct examination. \r\n\r\n"Why would I know something about my boss" - would avoid this phrasing.	Good rapport with the witness, and the pacing is natural between each question and answer. I felt that I could understand each part of the direct examination, which is important.\r\n\r\nGreat adaptability from attorney testifying to speculation - I overruled your objection, but good thinking on your feet.	I appreciate the hearsay objection to the parent's texts about getting married - but I would also exercise some caution and think whether getting this particular statement out of the record is going to be truly beneficial to your case.\r\n\r\nIf a witness says "you can say that," you gotta get a solid "yes" or "no." You as the attorney are saying something, but the witness has to say it as well. \r\n\r\nPretty good witness control! Asking for yes or no answers is a must in mock trial. Good job with not letting the witness meander and distract too much from what you want to hear. Good adaptability and keeping up with the witness, talking about her math skills.	7	4	8	9	Good talking speed! There's a lot of information to get out through Longstreet, and I felt that I could understand everything pretty coherently.	Don't directly admit to the bad parts of your affidavit! As a witness, there's usually ways to obfuscate bad parts of your affidavit. Would avoid repeating your cross answers, I heard "but he made a mistake" a couple times. Make sure to know the facts of your affidavit, at risk of being burned on impeachments.	Good pacing with the witness, the spacing between each question and answer doesn't sound very scripted and rather sounds quite natural. If it seems like the opposing counsel is getting on a roll with cross examination, you gotta object at least once to break up the flow and throw the other attorney off.	Never give up on objections! Even if you feel like you've lost, you have to say something beyond just no response. Pretty solid lack of foundation objection, good to throw off opposing counsel and making them perhaps ask more questions than they'd like. \r\n\r\nGreat tone with cross examination, very assertive in order to get the answers you want from the witness. Good witness control, asking for solid yes or no answers from the witness. I think the impeachment was amazing, but you have to go through the correct procedure, asking the witness to verify the affidavit and to ask the witness whether they knew that they could update the affidavit up to the date of the trial.	6	5	5	8	Good pacing with answers - expert witnesses are very hard to get right in terms of getting the jury to understand everything, and I felt that you got that done.	Don't directly admit to the bad parts of your report! Even if you aren't an explicit expert in robberies, you still have years of experience in the financial crimes department to refer to!	Don't give up on objections! Always have at least one response prepared for any objection, and the most important part about objection battles and trial is absolute confidence in what you're saying! Solid rapport with the witness and I felt that each part of the testimony was very understandable.\r\n\r\nThe crossing attorney referred to the close relationship between Kimball and Thomas even though that testimony was struck from the record, so you have to keep consistency and object to lack of foundation again.	Solid objections throughout the beginning of the direct examination, but don't get ahead of yourself -- let the opposing counsel finish their responses each and every time.\r\n\r\nWe haven't heard from witnesses that the security cameras are decoys. You have to establish that first, and if anything, it makes the prosecution look worse that the cameras are decoys, so emphasize that! Great witness control. Good job with emphasizing what is and what isn't in the witness testimony. \r\n\r\nYou struck out the testimony regarding the close relationship of Thomas and Kimball during direct, so to use that testimony in cross is in bad faith and I wouldn't go for it.	10	8	7	6	Great emotional portrayal of Whitney Bowman, quite convincing and empathetic. I don't know if the tears are real, but they look real, so big props for that. I also appreciate the variance in tone - you aren't always in tears, but rather more emotional in the right parts of the testimony.	Great responses to cross examination, asking the attorney to clarify their questions and not giving them any freebies. I thought you weren't too argumentative, answering properly to the right questions and being a bit fighty on the questions that you have a bit more leeway on. Emotional witnesses are hard to get right in mock trial, but you did great.	I appreciate establishing rapport by being on a first name basis with the witness. For the hearsay statement of Cameron Poole, you don't have to concede that - subsequent action or present sense impression are both hearsay exceptions here.  Match the energy of the witness, if she's beginning to tear up, don't go rapidfire questioning, slow down a bit and quiet down just a bit. You need to make sure the witness is the star of the show.	I overruled the hearsay objection towards the beginning, but I appreciate the creativity nevertheless. Great objection to hearsay for the text messages, and even though I overruled it, I enjoyed the objection arguments. Great speculation objection - it was a tough argument to make based on the minutiae of the wording of the question, but you did well. \r\n\r\nYou're never going to get a straight answer to asking a witness whether they lied, so I wouldn't go for it.\r\n\r\nMake sure to have the right materials for impeachment on the first go-around\r\n\r\nLet the witness finish their answers.	7	5	7	5	Mock trial is weird with its language standards, so "hell yeah" might not go well with some judges, but I like it, makes the testimony more realistic. It's not a good look to say that you snuck into an office because there was an argument. I understand the character of a disaffected employee, but you have to set some limits, as in saying that she has a midlife crisis isn't a good look.	I understand the character is a bit disaffected from working at the park, but don't ask the attorney whether they already asked you a question -- just answer the question and let the jury notice that they're repeating a question.\r\n\r\nOther than that, good job with making the crossing attorney clarify when necessary and not giving them freebies.	Good rapport with the witness, matching his energy and asking questions at a good pace and getting answers at a good pace. I like the phrasing of the questions, such as "Tell me a little bit more..." to let the witness be the star of the show.	Solid questions and good job with letting the witness finish their answers. It's better to let them go on at length and make themselves look less credible.	6	4	7	8	Experts are hard to make concise and digestible for the jury, but it's highly important for a clear case. Nevertheless, I like the slight character of a verbose expert. I'm not sure if these 84/87 percentages are actually in your report (if they are, disregard this), but if they are not, avoid using arbitrary percentages as one can object to this and voir dire you.	Answer the questions that the crossing attorney gives you. If they need to clarify the question, so be it. But ALWAYS answer the question, don't say anything like "you don't believe anything."	Good job with letting the witness be the main focus of the trial, letting them answer clearly and asking the questions at a good pace so that the jury can understand what evidence you're trying to get out onto the record.	This is a rare thing in mock trial, but if the witness is being non-responsive, you have to object to non-responsive. Otherwise, pretty good cross examination questions as well as witness control, pinning them on the right points you want to make.	9	Good repetition of the theme from the opening statements. Great emphatic, yet calm demeanor during closing to show that you have the facts but you still feel the conviction to argue on behalf of the prosecution. Great recap of the questions that the prosecution needed to answer as well as the evidence that the prosecution presented throughout the trial.\r\n\r\nGreat rhetoric all throughout the speech, and great pacing so that the jury can pick up on everything. Beautiful reversal of the defense's theme as well as emphasizing that crime does not have to actually succeed to be considered as crime.	10	Good job with adapting to technical difficulties - after having competed in zoom mock trial for a year, I fully sympathize with dealing with the entropic mess that is Zoom. Good use of the theme, "wrong place, wrong time, wrong person" throughout your speech. Great tone and body language throughout the speech, keeps the jury's attention on you at all time which is crucial. Great, emphatic refutation of the prosecution's evidence. \r\n\r\nGood job of clearly explaining the importance of the jury's work and decision.	66	109	171	136	137	138	140	169	139	141	t
248	10	Excellent opening, really good job. You are already an AMTA-level opener! I like how you weave the storyline, case theory, and case in chief prelude together seamlessly	9	Boom! Excellent job flipping their case theory in the end\r\nI like your demo, very effective at layering out the elements of charge\r\nTry to sound more enthusiastic or use more gesture and pauses throughout the direct, and try to make fewer slips during your speech, but overall the opening is great	8	7	8	9	Really interesting character, you told a good story\r\nI'm kinda confused about your character choice tho, I think a more compassionate and innocent entrepreneur type of person will actually do a better job than sounding angry and disgruntled (things like you wanted to exploit your employee might not be a beneficial thing to say for your character)\r\nOr try to develop an emotional arc	Really great job! Adding a bit of elaboration rather than just yes all along	Very good job fading into the background and let your witness take charge. \r\nCould signpost better	Greet the witness before starting the cross\r\nGood job hanging onto weak links in the direct and nailing that objection battle!\r\nI LOVED your composure and the way you commanded the cross!	9	9	10	8	Omg you got me with the Billie joke, LOVE your character, really natural tone of voice, you pulled a sympathy witness off effortlessly\r\nMake sure the upper half of your body is always in camera	You maintained your character perfectly on the cross, a great job disrupting the question flow and let your character shine	terrific! The entire line of questioning sounds very natural and rhythmic. This is a perfect direct	Always mention your ground when you are making objections\r\nI like how you presented the control panel exhibits side by side, very effective\r\nI think "distracted" and "didn't pay attention" are pretty much synonyms to me, so no need to hang on to that too much	8	6	8	9	I love your uniform, zoom background and demo! you even have a matching theme aaawww\r\nYour language choices are more formal and it matches well with your character\r\n\r\nMake sure to take some pauses before answering each question, this way you sound less scripted	You know your material and field of expertise well\r\nDon't be as fighty and aggressive as an expert witness because you are expected to adhere to evidence and evidence only & remain impartiality\r\nFor less important questions just let it pass (like whether you took the phone when examining it or whether cameron was always asking questions), it won't actually make too much of an impact on the jury's impression of the overall case. Make sure you are responsive to questions	Make sure to take some pauses before asking the next question \r\nyou could've objected when opposing counsel asked about the detective's dad?\r\nGood job amending hearsay obj & add limiting instruction, you have a very good grasp in ROE application	Objections greatly argued! You know your ROE well\r\nGood job connecting your cross to your opening statement narrative\r\n\r\nI like how you controlled the witness in a very non-imposing and friendly way, you asked for the judge's help when the witness kept on being nonresponsive, which is good	10	9	8	7	You got me laughing! Extraordinary character and accent, also funny answers\r\nVery good job taking pauses in between answers	Great job staying in character in cross	Good job fading into the background and let your witness take charge\r\nGood flow	Calls for hearsay not really necessary	8	7	8	9	I like your backstory, sympathy witness really convincing\r\ncut your answers short a little bit, this way your answers will be more memorable\r\nGood job with the emotional outburst	Could've responded to the impeachment better\r\nthe emotional buildup to the tunnel of terror question is a little stiff\r\nTry to sound sad thru the entire examination, have an emotional arc	Good job adapting to what happened in trial and ask about previous directs\r\n\r\nI like your dynamics with your witness\r\n\r\nwhy is taking out the last text message necessary? Good redirect tho	Great job, you nailed the impeachment, really sharp observation\r\nvary your question a bit more, instead of always ending with correct	9	8	7	8	I like your southern accent! so entertaining, very bubbly\r\nGreat flow	character is consistent in cross, good job	Good job guiding your witness\r\n\r\nLimit low-bar objections like asked and answered	Good job controlling your witness and getting the main points across\r\nI didn't get the impeachment though	8	I like your tone variation\r\nGreat job, you adapted and weaved in what happened in trial\r\nMake sure you structure your closing better, maybe not just in terms of witness testimony recap, but also in themes/buckets & add more argumentation	8	Good job, great tone variation \r\nI wish you revisited the elements of charge page and showed why prosecution didn't meet that burden	71	107	8	145	143	9	147	13	61	146	t
285	7	*gave him the scheme, knife, and escape. \r\n\r\nI'm going to nitpick a lot for this round (for all my comments). First of all, is the defendant a she, or a he? I'm sure I heard D refer to their party representative as a she. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that most of your judges for ANY mock trial round won't be familiar with the names. I think you rushed things in your narrative. I need a good idea of what Rachterworld is, who Haley Floyd and all these other names mean first. In both real trial and mock trial, your opening statement is directed at a jury, which usually means people who aren't extremely smart. I feel like your opening is a bit too technical. \r\n\r\nScheme = thousands of dollars, gave a knife, secured the only exit. \r\n\r\nYou stumbled perhaps 2-3 times. That surprised me.	6	Mr. Gong, this is definitely not proper formal attire. At least wear a shirt bro (although I didn't myself)\r\n\r\n*They needed a fall guy. Same comment regarding introductary narrartive to the left. If I don't even know who these people are, how would I understand WHO needs a FALL GUY for WHAT? \r\n\r\nYou sound like an attorney for sure. This is rare for students your age. The biggest issue is, you begin your opening and I immediately think, wow that sounds argumentative. Openings are previews. Without understanding essentially which characters are involved, you go straight to, guys, this is an inside job!	7	5	7	8	Loud, confident start. Great. And immediately you become a little bit soft spoken.  \r\n\r\nTone is excellent. Bit of a mock voice.  When the objection was overruled, you immediately smirked and glanced to your left. I noticed that, it breaks character. You're also nodding repeatedly when I rule in your side's favor. Don't do that.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote a comment to Ms. Huang's box, but consider it as well. In terms of character, I was hoping to see a stronger police character or perhaps some humor. To improve in the future I think you should consider that. Perhaps a costume. Perhaps some sort of stereotype. \r\n\r\nProbably co-conspirator, not companion.	"Absolutely no room for personal feelings" I simply don't buy that. Have you seen Bosch? That's a pretty good example of personal feelings helping a cop. \r\n\r\nI think he completely got you on the questions about the time. Should have been prepared =(	It's the same issue again, if this is the first witness, it's going to be his job to lay the frameworks of the case. If I'm a jury member, I STILL DON"T understand exactly what Racheterworld is.\r\n\r\nYour exhibits are rather blurry. \r\n\r\nSo who's going to tell me how much money the park lost? Definitely should have objected about the report (exhibit 2) the moment he started talking about the contents of the report.	That is tremendously interesting. I've never encountered a voir dire 3 minutes into trial. I know the case well, I can't see any way that you can voir dire this witness about his credibility as a financial crimes expert. AMTA's cases are carefully designed. \r\n\r\nTry to stand still my friend. \r\n\r\nYou talk too fast... And you should consider dividing up your cross into pockets. \r\n\r\nShowing exhibit 2, for a question, is really weird. And it doesn't follow procedure. You have to enter it (but not necessarily) into evidence to discuss the contents, police reports generally cannot be entered into evidence. She didn't object, it really worked out. \r\n\r\nWhy would you ask an open-ended question? If I'm the witness I would've given you a lengthy answer.	8	6	6	7	Didn't need the hacker thing.  Good jokes at the beginning. A bit of an echo on your end. The background tho, looks like a cheapstake boss to me. \r\n\r\nYou know what, I think you could've SAID that people stereotype you, and PLAY to stereotypes afterwards. I think that could potentially be very funny. \r\n\r\nGiven the opening and the first witness, I really think you could've had a clearer and perhaps longer why you are here in court today. That twist in emotion was very very sudden. I'm not sure if I buy it. Not long afterwards, you joke about your ex-wife.	I don't understand why you can't simply say "I'm sorry could you repeat that?" \r\n\r\nI like the apology A LOT. I just noticed how you could be making small eyes on purpose lol. Ok when it came to tax evasion, you sounded like you simply don't care. You keep on telling firing questions and comments back to the attorney. \r\nThat's okay once in a while for issues that YOU HAVE TO FIGHT, but not at this pace.\r\n\r\nYou suddenly became VERY EVASIVE near the end.	Remember to match your tone with your witness's. Ms. Jin, you're pausing at strange moments during your questions, I'm not sure why. \r\n\r\nOkay you definitely started to match your witness afterwards, good job. \r\nLack of effective signposting for your direct. For instance, you suddenly talk about, are employees allowed to operate other rides? It's highly likely that your judge will be confused since most judges pay attention to the round as much as student pay attention to chemistry exams. \r\n\r\nHe gave a very long, and a very argumentative question. You could have argued much more when it came to the improper character evidence objection. He asked a super compound question, 5 facts in one. Did not object. I felt like you wanted to but decided not to. I made it clear about when to object regarding tax issues during my ruling.	I'm curious if you objected if you saw me laugh. Probably should read the judge, if I laughed it probably means I liked that line. Additionally, I just don't think, even if there's prejdice (and I don't), it would be substantially more prejudicial. \r\n\r\nI think your first question completely backfired with your "of course". Ok, this is so weird. You objected to racial stereotypes, and you're kinda crossing about him being a racial stereotype. I guess I found that amusing, not scoring anybody up or down for this. \r\n\r\nYou have a tendency to whisper a word or two immediately after an answer. (right, yes, etc) Try to avoid doing that. \r\n\r\nWhy are you asking him to recite it? What if he actually knows the lines word for word? And this is potentially, a very weak point. I really didn't like this line of questioning. I think it has a high potential to backfire, it's trivial, and wastes your time too.	9	8	9	7	I think what's lacking at the beginning, is a roadmap. Why is this witness here in court today? I would've loved to see a good demo showing what everythinig means.\r\n\r\nFriendly and cheerful character. I think that's great. The transition to the night of the robbery is fantastic. What I think could've been done better is when you were describing the details of your interactions with Poole. You didn't sound distracted or "petrified" by the slightest.	Pretty much the same character on cross, until you got to the part about the officer.\r\n\r\nThe numbers part hurt you. The numbers part is very interesting. but "no decline" does not = no theft. It could've been different from anticipated revenue.	The smile is wonderful. Chemistry with your witness is very on point. Defendant and Mr. Poole is right. I probably would've had this witness start. Talk about the inner workings of R-world.\r\n\r\nI think you should just say that some of the conditions haven't been made.	The lack of personal knowledge objection seems very ji lei. And it gave Ms. Li a good chance to explain. \r\n\r\nIt seems clear that you're reading from notes because your eyes move to a certain point. Try to put your notes somewhere that I CAN"T notice. You should've seen that I wrote (and most judges are like this) penalize reading from notes. \r\n\r\nYour cx pockets aren't extremely clear.  Good reaction to the business record. Just remember you have to establish that the witness is also the custodian of the record. \r\n\r\nThe numbers part is very interesting. but "no decline" does not = no theft. It could've been different from anticipated revenue.	10	9	8	8	I love the intro! However the part about little George, is slightly narrative. The accent is amazing. The gestures, the fidgeting, the occassional stutter, man this is working well. \r\n\r\nOh the circles disappear too soon. The conversation between Floyd & Longstreet a little confusing.	Just a little bit too much when you got to "that's what Longstreet told us". I would've liked to see this witness, totally 100% unbiased. When you got to the pocket knife it was okay again. \r\n\r\nCx dragged on too long. I feel like if near the end, you tried to sound a little bored, it would've made sense.	What you did with it's actually me who misheard, and the way you did it. Rly good. \r\n\r\nI think your witness call order is flawed here. This is your first witness, but we don't know, that this whole issue is potentially Whit Bowman ACCIDENTALLY PULLING THE LEVER. \r\n\r\nI would've preferred if you slowed down just a little bit. Especially for zoom trial. \r\n\r\n"After hearing the defendant's lies, or claims" I feel like that's fair.	Ms. Li, you have this impression where you look kinda annoyed for just a second, when you're thinking of what to say. Maybe you can record one of your scrimmages and check. \r\n\r\nI think you controlled the witness decently. This is definitely a hard one. I wouldn't have used a soft spoken voice. He has a big personality, so I would've tried to be bigger. \r\n\r\nNotice how he's quickly picking up slight issues with the phrasing of your questions? And he just throws the question right back at you. I would've phrased the questions more carefully.	8	6	7	6	That's a good one. I think it's interesting how a lady of your age was first a ride operator, and later an intern. The explanation kinda made sense. It's an interesting approach.\r\n\r\nI feel like you're just a little bit over the top. The voice is fine, but you seem to be a tiny bit over eager. Another note is, you these chunks of testimony. You go very fast. Typically at this point (and not even considering the tech issues) judges' attentions get distracted. \r\n\r\nDespite the repeated interruptions, and I really thought about this, I think your direct is a little bit scattered.	Weird rules... Breaking into somebody's office... I don't think that's a great response. \r\n\r\nOkay the extremely lengthy answer you gave, is definitely bad. From that point on you instantly became fighty on my book. Three questions ago you admitted to the attorney that you're aware of rules, but you don't have to follow them, and three questions later you're confused to why you're supposed to be follow rules.	I might be wrong, but I think you could be the first directing attorney who asked why are you here in court today? \r\n\r\nThat exhibit has already been entered into evidence. Don't have to ask if it's the right copy again. \r\n\r\nNotes! Notes! Notes!	I'm generally not fond of, minor objections. I can't imagine any judge sustaining the lack of personal knowledge objection about the witness unable to say it's about 6 inches apart.\r\n\r\nMissed obvious speculation objection. Be patient with this witness. Control the witness. Be SLOW, LOUD. Use techniques like this, my question is xxxx, and your answer is a yes? \r\n\r\nWhy are you asking open-ended questions! "Do you think the tunnel of terror is easy to operate?" I heard at least 2. You asked clear questions TWICE. She's not giving you a yes or no. Either threaten to impeach, or object  non-responsive.	5	6	5	10	I would never, begin a direct, sounding devasted and on the edge of tears. It's not credible, and you don't really have a chance to highlight key testimony with the right emotions. \r\n\r\nThis is your side's key witness. I don't understand why there was so little time. I was willing to offer extra time as well, but the attorney didn't ask for it. As far as I see, this is a major strategic error.	You IMMEDIATELY STOP your semi-crying voice on cross. Or the shaking stops. That breaks credibility. \r\n\r\nWhen we got to the part, that "Poole made sure you didn't have to pay for any meals", the shaky voice is back again. I'm not sure how I feel about this.\r\n\r\nCertainly it's possible that you misheard the cx attorney, the problem is, she spoke extremely slowly. And since you don't have time for re-direct, I see this as a successful impeachment. \r\n\r\nI can slightly see why you're doing what you're doing, but combined with the impeachment and super quick direct, I'm sorry but it isn't working for me. You definitely have potential in terms of acting, I just think strategically there were errors make. I'd love to see you again in another competition.	Avoid asking vague questions like "Could you provide details"? A solid direct should be like two friends having a friendly chat over coffee. There should be chemistry. We don't want anything that kinda sounds like “你啥意思我没懂”\r\n\r\nHaving "I thought" doesn't qualify everything as non-speculation. \r\n\r\nThis is your side's key witness. I don't understand why there was so little time. I was willing to offer extra time as well, but the attorney didn't ask for it. As far as I see, this is a major strategic error.\r\n\r\nCould have objected improper character evidence for ringtoss?	Tone is just right. Good job.\r\n\r\nCX executed perfectly up until impeachment, when there was a slight echo. Well done. I wouldn't change anything.	9	You're slightly fidgeting. Pacing left and right, forward and backwards. \r\n\r\nWith a cross you had, I'd definitely begin with a key moment in trial. You have to show that your closing isn't 100% scripted, but maybe 70%. Almost all judges will score you up if you can demonstrate how you're using the ACTUAL testimony from your trial, and adjusting accordingly. \r\n\r\nDemo can be prettier.	8	*they need a fall guy, and here we are. \r\n\r\nIncredibility? Compare the video set-up between you and Ms. Jin. With yours, I CAN"T see your hand gestures clearly. Police officers, and a lot of them, graduate from police academies. Think about the movie 美版无间道。The same advice I have for Ms. Jin, I have for you. Closings should use stuff that actually came out during trial. \r\n\r\nYour vocal variations are very on point. I'm not sure if this is weird to say, my first mock trial I had to do closings. For some reason you remind me of myself. If you're new, I'm impressed. I'd be happy to work with you and everybody on your team. A lot of raw talent.	63	36	99	104	155	158	154	102	156	103	t
284	9	Really nice opening. I like that it's really structured and that there was a really clear theme. Overall I'd say that this is a successful opening, there was good engagement with the juries, and nice use of rhetorics; one thing I'd noticed, however, is that personally, there were a bit too pauses you utilized to iterate your points during the half end of the speech. Just a minor detail though.	8	I appreciate that you put a lot of emotions into giving your opening statement. However, to me personally, you came off almost like you were angry for the defendant and I would personally suggest slightly more objectivity and a tone more flat in terms of your delivery. Otherwise great speech.	10	10	8	8	Love the vibrancy you brought into your character. Really natural portrayal too.	I really liked your concession with your superhero joke. Great job staying in character during cross.	Great directions and response during cross.	There's a great attempt of debate about Rule 803 regularly conducted activity. I'd appreciate some introductions (laying foundations for some details) during some of your cross-questions; given the premise that most judges do not read the case packet. sometimes it's hard to understand who you are referring to.	8	6	8	7	Great delivery and everything was really clear.	You were quite resistant during cross-examination and sounded unsure with some questions during cross. It's important to stay in the same character that you gave off during direct. Even as an expert witness you could enhance the objective and assertive nature of your delivery.	Nice line of questioning. Nice hearsay objection during cross.	Great hearsay argument. This is what an objection argument should be like. Remain calm during objection battles, it's important that counsels stay calm to be professional.	10	9	9	7	I'm not that big of a fan of the first joke that you threw at the beginning of the trial but you executed it quite well. Nice portrayal, sometimes it's the little details that matter the most.		Clear directions and engagement with jury members. Great response in objection battles; nice job.	At times during cross, you were quite aggressive even edging on badgering. I'd suggest that you could add more objectivity during your cross. Other than that you made some great points during objection battles.	8	7	8	8	Nice portrayal of the defendant character.	Avoid being impeached. Nice response to the opposing attorney's attack though.	"what was your next course of action" too many times. other than that great. You could use hearsay to attack their impeachment process.	Good impeachment attempt.	7	9	7	8	Clear demonstration of the character of evidence.	I really like your responses in your cross, really stayed in the character and retained the sass.	Didn't think the Badgering the Witness objection was necessary. Could've just asked the opposing counsel to not talk over your witness. Great calls for speculation objection. Response to nonresponsive is nice.	Really good fight during objection battles. I liked it that you remained calm even when the witness is super fighty.	6	6	8	9	I'm confused about what kind of character you are trying to portray.	A bit fighty. Some answers you could have made a concession.	nice line of questioning. Just because the opposing counsel talked over the witness doesn't mean it's automatically badgering the witness. Just ask the opposing counsel to let the witness finish.	really clear cross, great job.	8	The puzzle demonstration is cute. The use of jury instructions, putting them up on the screen even, is quite smart. The "the defense wants you to believe" rhetoric is really strong.	9	I like your delivery tone a lot, sounds like you are laying out a story. The "presumption of innocence" argument is working quite well.	62	103	168	160	50	52	164	161	51	54	t
269	6	Could have more eye contact and depended too much on the notes.	9	Very good opening. \r\nTold a good story, and used varied volume and tone for emphasis.\r\nGood substance and technique.\r\nAct professionally and confidently.	9	9	8	8	Built strong characters, really lovely, I like your performance:)\r\nStrong voice and eye contact.\r\nGreat movement, inflections, and gestures.	Stayed in character and built credible portrayal of the character.\r\nSounded spontaneous, not memorized, great!\r\nGood ability to hold up on cross.\r\nCould avoid some unnecessarily long answers on cross examination.	Appropriate objections and responses to objections.\r\nHelped the witness shine and kept the focus on the witness.	Appropriate objections and responses to objections.	8	9	6	7	Great character.\r\nStrong voice and eye contact.	Stayed in character and built credible portrayal of the character.\r\nSounded spontaneous, not memorized, really great!	Could involve more in the objection battle.	Very confident and act professionally.\r\nSmooth and effective line of questions .\r\nCould try to argue more in the objection battle.	6	7	5	8	Could build a stronger character.\r\nBeing polite and courteous.	Good ability to hold up on cross.\r\nAvoided unnecessarily long answers on cross, great.	Could have more eye contact and depend less on the notes.\r\nCould try to respond more to the objection.	Appropriate objections and responses to objections.\r\nGreat movement, inflections, and gestures.\r\nConfidence, composure, professionalism.	8	7	7	9	Strong character with the crying tone, really good.\r\nGreat movement, inflections, and gestures.	Good ability to hold up on cross.\r\nStayed in character.	Appropriate objections and responses to objections.\r\nInternet disorder too many times but not your fault!	Appropriate objections and responses to objections.\r\nEffective use of exhibits.\r\nConfidence, composure, professionalism.	8	8	8	6	Stayed in character.\r\nBuilt credible portrayal of the character.\r\nWould be better if off-book.	Good ability to hold up on cross.\r\nAvoided unnecessarily long answers on cross.\r\nGood preparation and knowledge of affidavits and facts.	Confidence, composure, professionalism.\r\nHelped the witness shine and kept the focus on the witness.\r\nGood job.	Could involve more in the objection battle.\r\nSeems like a little bit tired, get good rest!	7	6	7	7	Built good character.\r\nWould be better if perform off-book.	Stayed cool.\r\nBut better not argue with opposing counsel, be more polite and courteous.	Helped the witness shine and kept the focus on the witness.\r\nCould be more confident in tone.\r\nAppropriate objections and responses to objections.	Smooth and effective line of questions.\r\nSome good responses to the objection.\r\nRaise objection more!	7	Used an assertive voice, I really liked that.\r\nVaried volume and tone for emphasis.	9	Good contact with the jury.\r\nGreat movement, inflections, and gestures.\r\nConfidence, composure, professionalism.\r\nThough I didn't hear that clearly due to the Internet disorder, anyway, GOOD JOB.	66	123	138	171	136	137	169	140	141	170	t
226	8	Good pacing. Haha is this a stock photo of winston thomas. Easy to follow open. Smooth and conversational delivery -- really nice job. Try segmenting the open a little (split things up into discrete pieces at your witness section, i.e. pieces of evidence, time points, whatever you choose) and explaining the names/places a little bit more. For ex) you'll hear about racheter world, a theme park right here in Midlands. That extra bit of context goes a long way. Nice overall.	7	Interesting theme. Nice pacing. Vary tone more. Repeat theme more. just need a little more of a dynamic delivery and you're solid. I like the three questions. Very clear writing though, easy to follow.	7	7	6	8	I like this accent. Cute background. Wait did the accent turn southern? Nice energy -- I think just tighten up the accent a little bit.	Consistent performance -- maintained credibility. Good job not fighting too much but you lost a little bit of enthusiasm.	"that's a great dream" Cut editorializing language. Very conversational with witness. Include more signposts to organize the direct. \r\n\r\nRe the hearsay objection on the CX -- questions aren't statements because they're not assertions of fact. So questions aren't hearsay. \r\n\r\nFor objections -- use them wisely -- not all statements are hearsay. And sometimes they don't really matter. For ex mind your own business is a command, so make sure to focus on what's really a statement. Generally I think it's good to ask for a limited instruction.	Great job with the objection responses on CX. Break up the longer quotes. Need a little bit more energy at your important points. Great job keeping questions short. Integrate signposts to segment the CX and signal important points.	7	6	7	8	Tighten the accent up a little bit. But good energy throughout.	Nice job -- fight a little bit less. It's ok to agree to bad facts if your tone is friendly when you're doing it.	Good demeanor on DX. Add more signposts so info is easier to follow.	Good job with the witness control but try not to cut the witness off. It gets a little bit chaotic on zoom. Add signposts so info is easier to follow.	7	8	7	7	Try to build up a little bit more confidence as an expert. Nice job overall.	Nice job on CX. You held up well -- need a little more confidence though. I like your tone on CX more than on DX. You sound a little bit more like yourself here. Careful not to fight too much on conclusions.	Try to have a more conversational flow with the witness. More pauses/big moments to emphasize important points.	Good job with the witness control. Change your tone on important points/vary it a little bit more. Add signposts to make it easier to follow. Experts are tough -- good job.	7	7	6	7	You need a little bit more energy. Try to find some more moments for the cheery peppy character. You had it in a couple places but I think you can integrate it more consistently.	Good job not fighting too much and maintaining credibility.	You need to lay more foundation on this direct. You're jumping between a lot of different facts and different events without telling us how this witness got to each one or is familiar with each one. Walk us through the facts more.	This cross was really short -- I think you can add a little bit more drama. Missed some important pieces of evidence in this CX. Vary your tone more throughout to improve delivery.	9	6	9	7	Wow what a burst of energy -- this witness really brought me to life. The state of midlands is a safe haven for alcoholics omg. You had me laughing so hard at that one.	Where did the jokes go? I missed those. i think you can play off the impeachment with the type of character you're doing -- perfect place to throw in a joke to diffuse impact. Especially because that impeachment wasn't on a super important fact.	You have a really energetic witness so nice job letting him be the star. Good conversational tone. Need more signposts so it's easier to follow. \r\n\r\nReally great job with the 803(2) explanation but honestly I don't think you need it. The statement isn't asserting any facts, not for the truth, so not hearsay.	Need more energy on this CX. You either need to make a bigger deal of the impeachment or not do it. It didn't seem super significant even though you were right.	8	6	6	8	You're being accused of a crime -- need a little bit more emotion on this witness in whatever form that may be. \r\n\r\nEmotion picked up better when you talked about the whole tunnel being dark. Need more of that a little bit earlier in the direct.	Ah the impeachment reactions needs to be a little bit calmer. Otherwise looks too incriminating. Even though she didn't actually do it her point was made because you contradicted -- sometimes that happens. There's a lot of info in these affidavits. But if you realize you're wrong, try to just play it off a little bit more genuine in character rather than super high energy.	Need more foundation in general, especially since this is the defendant. Try to ground objection responses a little bit more strongly in the rules. Good tone overall. You need a little bit more organization in this direct though -- it was tough to follow.	Why object to the terms and conditions? Do you care if those statements come in? I don't think it's something worth objecting over. But good catch on the lack of personal knowledge, I was waiting for that one. \r\n\r\nFor your lack of foundation obj -- I see what you're saying but it would be more effective to do an attorney testifying objection for things like that, not lack of foundation. Or phrase it like there's been no foundation laid that there actually were any fingerprints on the box. But also -- doesn't that help you? Don't you want there to be fingerprints on the box? \r\n\r\nNice lead-up to the impeachment -- even if you didn't actually get to do it your point was made. Well done. \r\n\r\nButton vs. lever section was good.	9	I like the beginning a lot with the one moment -- very responsive. \r\n\r\nNeed more structure in the close overall. You can go element by element, or pieces of evidence -- since you had a three part theme I think that it would be helpful if you more explicitly structured using that. Need more tone variation and speed variation. Pauses go a long way.	8	Nice job overall -- but need to be more responsive as D close. Integrate  moments through trial -- don't just summarize your case -- summarize what actually happened in this specific trial that supports you.  Got there with Kimball -- need more of that throughout though. \r\n\r\nNeed more tone variation and speed variation.	61	142	21	76	77	23	24	79	80	26	t

247	8	Nice job of giving us a clear story about what happened at the ToT\r\n\r\nExcellent pace in the opening.  Fine use of dramatic pauses to grab our attention.\r\n\r\nThere is no real transition to your discussion of the defendant lied and few details about the story of the theft by deception.  We have a clear picture of the robbery and a rather murky story regarding the ticket scam.	8	Nice job of telling us a story that explains why we should wonder if the detective's bias screwed up the investigation.\r\n\r\nSolid theme...might connect the flawed investigation to the beyond reasonable doubt standard.  To erase all doubt, one has to believe that police did their job properly.  If the assumption that they arrested the right person for the right reasons is cast into doubt, that matters.  \r\n\r\nProbably would be easier if you showed us the two control panels in the opening.	7	7	7	8	You need more vocal variety.  Every answers sounds much the same.  You are not using your voice to amplify your presentation of key facts.\r\n\r\nNice job of showing anger regarding Bowman and the ToT\r\n\r\nThe discussion of "blackout mode" is somewhat sparse...we could use a longer discussion since our understanding of what happens in the tunnel is pivotal to your side's theory.\r\n\r\nMight show us the control panel.		The story could be told more effectively if you organized it around a few key topics as opposed to running us through the events chronologically.  \r\n\r\nGiven how little attention was given to the tickets in the opening, we really don't know why the witness is talking about the ticket booth.  The opening's gap in coverage makes it hard to follow what the witness's discussion has to do with the charges facing the defendant.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, I am not sure that this witness has established very much regarding the scam at the ticket booth.	There are places where  map would make it easier to follow the cross.\r\n\r\nA well structured cross and you do a great job of controlling the witness.\r\n\r\nYour questions about Bowman scheming with Poole is doing the prosecution's work for them.    There are questions in the pocket where you are practically are repeating prosecution points  in stronger terms than we heard from the other side.	6	6	7	8	Not sure that the character that you have constructed is one that enhances the credibility of the witness.   Is a seemingly feeble older person all that credible or do we silently wonder about their memory?\r\n\r\nIntroducing the idea that you have memory issues is terrible idea Deliberately tanking your credibility is an absurd dramatic choice.		Bowman lied to the witness   The witness got fired because of Bowman telling a lie.   I am not sure that you bring out this fact as clearly or as powerfully as you might have.   It also takes a lot of time to cover this ground.\r\n\r\nYou go through the discussion of being asked about the blackout mode and the meeting with Poole far too quickly.  If you want these facts to stick with us, you need have more questions exploring the topic.	Nice job of bringing out the possibility that the incident could have been caused by accident.\r\n\r\nHow does the Chuggie's meeting fit into the defense case?   Given the opening did not deal with this topic, we really don't have any framework for plugging this set of facts into your story.	9	8	8	8	Slow down.  You are racing through your answers at very rapid rate.\r\n\r\nYou do a great job of slowing down when you are working with the visual aids. It was really only a problem when you were running though the biographical details.		Excellent structure and good use of the visual aid.\r\n\r\nThe objection on the text messages is well argued.  \r\n\r\nDraw more attention to the fact that Bowman lied to her about the phone.	You really are letting this witness as "a conduit for hearsay" and I am willing to bet that case law speaks to that topic (Mississippi BBQ???)    There were lots of opportunities to object.\r\n\r\nThere is no field of expertise that lets an expert invade the province of the finder of fact.  Such opinions do not assist the jury (a prong for experts) and serve to confuse the jury (another rule that matters).\r\n\r\nNice job of pointing out the witness's possible bias.\r\n\r\nIt is not obvious how the circumstances surrounding the taking of the phone is helpful to your side.  Whatever point you are trying to make is quite elusive. \r\n\r\nThe discussion of Hunter is an interesting topic, but the organization of this pocket is more confusing than it needs to be.  In part, that is because your questions are longer than they should be.	8	8	6	8	Interesting character, nice job on the accent.		It seems as if you doing the prosecution's work by spelling out the wristband scheme in better detail than we got from the prosecution.  What was the point of your side asking these questions?	Nice job of  drawing out Poole's confession that the tickets were something Poole was doing with "friends"\r\n\r\nNice job of getting the witness to reemphasize the damning parts of the first phone conversation.	7	6	7	9	You don't do much to deflect the damning parts of the text message.  Even if we believe Kimball was the author of the last message, we do need to have some understanding of the messages at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\n    The discussion of the robbery has an answer that is much too long...so long that we could easily miss the claim that you did not know a robbery was taking place  That lack of knowledge needs to stand out.	That was clearly an invention of a material fact (a circumstance that does give rise to impeachment by omission).  \r\n\r\nThe "vomit" as a reason for switching rides is really a topic that should have been presented in the direct.	When you put the defendant on the stand, the jury expects to hear a clear denial (or a compelling explanation) from the defendant.  The defendant has a story to tell and that means that the defendant should be presenting the facts in an order that tells the story of their innocence\r\n The directing attorney should fade into the background and not impose some artificial order on the denial.\r\n\r\nOf course the witness knows why they are in court.  That is a strange question for a criminal defendant.\r\nA redirect on a successful impeachment is pointless.\r\n\r\nDecent job of drawing out some of the bad facts rather than leaving the witness out to dry on cross.	Nice job on the impeachment.    I sure hope that surfaces in the closing.\r\n\r\nNice job of highlighting the differences between ths stop button and the blue lever.\r\n\r\nFine job on drawing our attention to the lies told to the police.	7	7	7	8	An absolutely great voice for a journalist.  Very credible.\r\n\r\nThe witness is not telling a tight story and it is requiring considerable work to see how what you are saying is helpful to the defendant.  \r\n\r\nYou blow through the "two sets of books" mystery very quickly....you should be able to flesh out the implications of a business having two sets of books.  That would fall under the reasonable inference rule.		From both a psychological and logical standpoint, it is difficult to understand why the defendant is testifying in the middle position and a seemingly minor fact witness is your final witness.\r\n\r\nIf the witness is going to be breaking some real important news, it seems that we should have gotten a preview in the opening statement.  At best,  the witness is adding to the "Kimball screwed up" pile.	On the impeachment, it would be helpful if we knew what piece of testimony is at issue.   It seems that the witness has read Kimball's report and thus there is a way for the witness to say that the phone call is sort of in the statement.\r\n\r\nNice job with the "what you can't tell us"....	9	Fine job of condensing the case to three memorable (and quite compelling) facts\r\n\r\nExcellent job of summarizing the details that Bowman knew what Poole was doing at the ticket booth\r\n\r\nNice job of reminding us about Bowman's admission to deleting incriminating messages.  \r\n\r\nFine point on "Bowman not being there by accident."\r\n\r\n(The map would certainly have helped explain why Bowman had to be there)\r\n\r\nThe lie told to Issacs deserved a bit more prominence in your summary of Bowman's lies.   Wonderful that you are using the impeachment to push this point regarding Bowman's credibility.	7	You really need to be adjusting to what happened in this particular trial.  The other side has really focused on Bowman's credibility and you need to work to diminish the damage done by those attacks.  We either need to be given reasons to trust what we heard on the stand from Bowman or told that we should set the lies aside and focus on clear hard facts.   Which probably means that you needed to spend more time with the pictures of the control panel.  People lie; pictures don't.\r\n\r\nWhere is the case law that supports the idea that getting profits from the crime is an element of the offense?   \r\n\r\nThe Longstreet-Floyd-Poole meeting is so underdeveloped as an argument that it probably didn't deserve attention in the close.  It so little attention during the trial that it is hard to see why you are discussing  that topic.\r\n\r\nWhen did we hear the evidence that Bowman was arrested at 8:19? That testimony was certainly not made memorable when it was brought out during the case in chief.	71	97	8	9	143	145	12	147	11	146	t
249	6	You seem a rather casual and laid-back prosecutor, which I am not sure is the best stylistic choice. Try to avoid looking like you are staring at the script, which should not be hard on zoom.	8	I appreciate that you are standing up, but that makes you look down upon the judge. You manage the changes in your voice well. "Any effort to make it anything but an accident is just making Bowman the scapegoat" seems very unnecessarily aggressive. Your client is falsely accused and that's enraging, but you have to try to make it professional and trustworthy instead of overly defensive.	7	8	6	8	You seem like a reliable accountant type which is good.	You fought the questions well and remained calm.	You should have protected your witness more when the opposing counsel was going after him.	Relatively immaterial objections including foundation instead of more substantive ones should not happen too frequently. You shouldn't have given up the fight on improper character evidence. Simply argue that they are lying, they are literally using this to prove that Poole committed a crime, including doing it together with Bowman. \r\n\r\nThere were way too many comments during the cross. Badgering a witness for his fear at knifepoint is usually a bad look. I other appreciate your emotional expressions and demeanor.	8	8	8	6	You were very easy to understand and follow. You looked very credible and not like someone who is only concerned about profits.	You fought the prior accident issue well.	You were very calm and responded to objections professionally.	I would cut down on immaterial objections. The cross questions were too long. You looked like you were looking at a script and had no eye contact. You had to explain your question as to the prior accident, which opened the door for the witness to fight it and made your questions weak. The Billie Isaacs issue should not have been brought up through this witness.	7	6	6	8	Good use of demonstratives.	You were a little too fighty with some questions, which end up looking bad.	It took too long to get to the party opponent exception, which should have been obvious. You should have anticipated some predictable objections.	Again, cut down on immaterial objections. Otherwise, there were a few valid ones. You are familiar with the rules of evidence, which is good. Why is it a problem that a police detective wants to hold someone accountable for a horrific crime?	5	5	5	7	Again, an unusually short direct. Don't answer the judge directly unless the judge specifically directed them at you. The judge was asking your attorney to reask a question.	You were scrambling to answer some predictable questions.	That was a really short direct.	Good answers to the "privacy" objection issue. I was not on board with having an open-ended question like that, but it worked here. The "stingy" question was supposed to discredit Hunter, which would avoid the improper character evidence issue.	9	8	8	5	Lovely persona. Solid information.	Good responses except for when the crosser was asking about the text. If you already admitted to picking someone up, the text was immaterial. He gave you open-ended questions to explain yourself which could have been better utilized.	Good witness prep and questions to get out how unsafe this place is from a seemingly exuberant witness.	You seem to think there was nothing objectionable in the direct. Your skill to control witnesses needs some improvement.	7	7	6	8	A crying witness is a fair and favorable interpretation of this defendant. But sometimes I could barely hear you.	You stayed in character very well.	Don't just tell your witness to calm down. Try to soften your tone in a circumstance like that. Direct is too short.	Giving her a second in the beginning worked well. You were professional throughout the cross.	7	You seemed to have a very defense-friendly definition of "beyond a reasonable doubt." You looked like you were reading from a script without eye contact. Very argumentative with regards to all witnesses, which has its pros and cons. I wouldn't want to go overly aggressive with this. I would especially carefully phrase how Bowman was crying the whole time.	8	I appreciate the case theory. The zealous attitude of a defense attorney is appropriate. Avoid saying "my client."	73	98	37	126	35	122	38	121	124	41	t
283	9	follow the bracelets, the blade, and the blackout. great energy at the start. loved the delivery on far from carefree. your left hand is flying around wildly, try to be a bit more deliberate in the hand gestures. good hand gesture for turning off all the lights. you have a great story telling presence, but I want to hear more "you will hear" or "the evidence is going to show" - that's standard language for opening statements . try to pause before and go a little slower on the law, and count 3-4 missisippies before u get to the law. this opening has a very logical structure that I like. pause before each "1st, 2nd, 3rd" -- it helps me internalize that structure. maybe you can use more specific hand gestures or body movement for sneaking, pushing, etc. instead of waving the hand around. preying on the parks prosperity, nice. you make me feel indignant and sorry for the victim, really good emotional depth. "if any reasonable doubt crosses your mind" -- don't need to say this line, you can end much stronger just by pausing and saying "at the end of this trial .  overall solid delivery.	8	pretrial: try to all come on screen at start. looks more professional.\r\nopening: \r\nbowman was shot, an arrow of betrayal. \r\ngreat passion at the start. not a fan of starting with date "on aug 30". great delivery on the knife. you have great delivery on "moment of panic" but I want to see you go slower and build more suspense - more pauses, speaking slower. the demo with the questions is cool. tech issue was unfortunate, I didn't doc you down any points for it. you have great energy but I want to see more "low's" -- drops in volume, going quieter, building that shock and awe. interesting line with the jurors. for the "hand gesture" I would flip the hand for how you show the 4 - looks more confident. I think the jump from the most likely to the theme was a little abrupt. try not to say "in conclusion" it's unneeded, I loved your passion throughout the opening, but similiar to the P opener I would have liked to see more variance in the emotion.	8	9	7	7	bubbly energy, nice. resident nerd haha. the lovechild of a dumpster fire and train wreck. lol. the rochter world has prepared a demonstrative - this quote felt scripted and didn't fit your demonstrative.  a lot of numbers that went over my head. nice tone transition to the day you got robbed. great emotion on he wasn't supposed to be there. solid ending.	nice clarifying question at the start. haha I felt like a bit like a detective. but I think you need to sound a little more sad, because you just finished talking about a traumatic event. really good job staying in character, you sounded very believable.	coordination was a little off on the good afternoon/good evening. good rappor with witness. don't like it a demonstrative, call it a chart. try to "press slide show" so I can see the full demo. I am a little confused on why we talked about exhibit 7 and the demo. decent objection responses but need to sound more confident. need to sound more sad on "im so sorry".  instead of what was ur reaction to mr poole's actions, maybe ask something like "what did u do after he threatened u with the blade" -- try to loop ur theme in whenever u can and loop her scary answers. I like your demeanor but I want to see you get more emotional when the witness gets emotional.	while I appreciate the argument, reserve 403 for very very very bad things. it's used to exclude pictures of dead bodies in real life and most judges are aware how high of a a bar it is. maybe you wanted to object lack of foundation instead, as to why the witness. be careful about objecting opinion testimony and saying she talked about fraud when she was only talking about numbers. I would have sustained the objection if you said they haven't laid foundation for other prongs of 803(6). missed the spec objection on "poole must have been ... and pocketing the money."\r\ndon't say "I'll take as a yes" --> just ask the witness "is that a yes or a no" nice line of questioning on "you did not see" - very good. if she wouldn't talk about her own knife, doesn't that make your client look guilty? try to speak a little slower, you have great emotional variance (being casual with her at times while also being assertive with getting your answers). im not sure what the point of the last exhibit was - I've never seen this case before so you have to dumb it down for a simpleton like me.	6	5	6	8	nice costume. you sound very professional. too many facts on that one answer at the start, it's overwhelming. need emphasis on certain words like theft, need more hand gestures. not a fan of a police officer explaining probable cause / legal things - just because they have probable cause doesn't mean the person actually did the crime, that's for the jury to decide. keep it simple like "why did u arrest him" because x yz. I like the clarification on informing him of his rights.	nice clarification at the start and admitting your mistake, adds credibility. but the "was very helpful" response is too voluntary. let the bad facts roll over your head. too defensive on she was frontant and im sorry it has been over a year. being too defensive on "probable cause" - just saying yes preserves your credibility. most scorers care less about witnesses admitting to bad facts as opposed to making them seem like they're not a big deal - that comes from your demeanor and not sounding defensive. why not say yes to "you asked him many questions" -- it adds to your credibility. Pick only a few points to fight on - I liked the FC regulations fight and the "whenever I wanted to" fight -- the others weren't needed. nice energy on 200 cases as a lead detective.	good shift to inquisitive tone. don't need the comment on "that is cert. impressive." im not sure what the rules of the competition are, so this won't affect your score, but generally for AMTA you don't need to formally enter the witness in as an expert. just ask the foundational questions like what r ur qualifications (702a), what did u look at in ur investigation (702b), etc. need to break up more of these answers with questions. thank you clarifying the text messages, the more you can make it easy for me to understand, the better. would have liked the red text for ToT too, tho i dont know if thats possible. "is there anything else that u think would be helpful" -- too scripted, needs to ask a more specific question. even if it was "peach dark" that wouldn't be argumentative - it's cx, the witness can respond yes or no. character evidence doesn't apply to actions that are connected to the case, it would be character evidence if she brought up bad stuff this officer did for a completely separate case. leading question. I appreciate the objections though, you have a very good comfort with the evidence.	I think you could have objected lack of foundation under 702 for when they wanted to admit her in as an expert. they didn't talk too much about 702b c and d. this ended up hurting you when they cited 703. coulda objected speculation to "she lied" -- thats inferring a malicious intent, it's not rationally based perception. good line of questioning, on you didn't see you didn't see. maybe call it a blade if u wanna attack their theme. solid line of questioning, but I want to see more tonal variation. not sure if it was planned or not, but nice reference to what they said on dx exam. really solid headers on "let's talk about." don't say "cool" lol. for the hearsay arg, you can just say "questions are not hearsay" - there's no truth value in a question. nice aggressive line of question on "cut her off," but she got away with saying no?. you had a very fighty witness but it's important to not look upset when you control. the leading question objection was 1 question too late.	8	7	7	8	the brazenness. loooool. nice on "something, something was wrong." if you say he "seemed" aggressive then it's not spec anymore - for future reference.  I think you can sound more distressed when talking about the dude in tears on the sidewalk. good emotion on i dont give permission to whit or anyone else.	I liked your demeanor but you seemed a little frazzled/upset after she cut you off. try to keep the energy going - don't let . I like the yes (and then you elaborate a little where you agree) - I don't like the yes (but then you say something she didn't ask about),	great demeanor at the start. nice "let's explain the wristbands for the MOTJ". maybe call it a bracelet so you can get your theme in?  great inquisitive tone  on do you know why there was a decrease. I think you had a great response to the spec objection. good reactions to deal with rulings that hurt you, but I would plan more in advance to avoid them. good response to the vague and amibitious but u gotta watch out for that hearsay.  solid inquisitivenesss I really like your dx demeanor. if she isn't letting the witness finish his answer, feel free to object. really good character evidence objection.	I really liked the LOF objection, I think you gotta point me to specifically  what he said and why they haven't laid foundation for it in order for me to sustain it. good witness control is that a yes to my question. don't say "I'll take that as a yes."	7	4	6	7	I like how earnest you sound. some of these answers are too long, I can't digest all of the info for me. tattoo?  lol. i might be broke and didnt go to college line was really good, you sound very believable.  too many names and too many facts flying at me. the panic about seeing a real gun  was very authentic. I like the stuff about you having to help. love the I was so so scared and being shaken. moments like that where it's really intense it's okay to ramble - but you shouldn't do that on the buildup questions - for the buildup there should only be 1-2 facts per question.	echoing some of my previous comments, it's important to not come across as defensive. more "yes and" and less "yes but". "well why does she need to" waaaaaay too defensive. good response to you panicking - that's a good place to talk back on, I like that over the previous fights. being way tooooooo defensive. don't deny things that you wrote or said. I have to mark you down for that. I think you are very comitted to your character with the hand cuffs and the prison get up which is very very solid and you sound very earnest, you just gotta pick and choose your battles. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, there are two kinds of impeachment, impeachment by contradiction and impeachment by omission. Impeachment by contradiction happens when you contradict something that you said before - it doesn't have to be in your affadavit, it can be in an exhibit too. Impeachment by omission happens when you say something on the stand that you didn't include in your affadavit - as a tactic, it's not recommended to be used unless the invention on cross was very big. If they impeach you on something you made up (like a funny character) and it looks petty, they won't get scored up for it. But if it looks \r\n\r\n\r\nMy impression was that you were denying something that you wrote or agreed to in an exhibit - you can still be impeached on that.	i think u can break up these answers with more questions, give me more bite-sized info to chew on.  your tone should also match her energy - when she gets excited, you get excited, etc.  "is there anything you would like to say about x" -- too scripted. good empathy at the end. good 803(6)(a) argument. if there is no inconsistency, you can redx on what she was shown, or you can reobject hearsay and say that under 801(d) there was no prior inconsistent stateemnt.	missed some lack of foundation objections. good witness on asking you yes or no q's and elaborating on redx. go over the steps for impeaching with omission with your coach. here is a sample:\r\nyou remember writing an affadavit \r\nyou swore to tell the truth in that affadavit\r\nyoud recoginize the affadavit if i showed it to u\r\nyh permission to display\r\nthis is ur affadavit\r\nthats ur signature at the bottom\r\nnowhere in ur affadavit do u say x\r\n\r\ngood 803(6)(a) argument. good zoom in. \r\ngood controlling on answers.	8	8	8	9	fanstastic start lmao. you gave really good energy, but I would like to see more tone variation.	oof he kinda got you on the wine but I liked your responses and you handled it well. I think your demeanor was consistent on cx which was good. when you fight the first time, say yes to when he controls otherwise you look defensive. I appreciate the brief yesses or no's but I echo my previous comments about saying "but" too much.	good inquisitive tone.  I would like to you see break up more questions and use more headers like "let's talk about x." ending was a little confusing. good objection. try to be more concise and state what it is you were actually objecting to.	HAHA. starting off by crossing a character on stuff they were doing on dx, I love stuff like that. good witness control. good emphasis on "usually, usually." I would have liked to see more headers and apuses	7	6	9	9	fun zoom background, but what does the pat mean? not sure about cussing on the stand but I guess it came off naturally.	"mmm yess but" -- you didn't need to fight here. let the bad facts roll off of you. good response on "I'm hoping to find the truth" - that was the only fight you needed	clear, inquisitive and slow line of questioning, I like it a lot. I would still like to see more headers like "i want to talk about x now, let's talk about abc." That breaks it down and simplifies it even more. good loop on "what happened to the boy who got caught." I was confused about the importance of the ending.	I appreciated that start a lot. great presence and command during the cross.	8	good energy at the start but not a fan of the puzzle thing. Maybe start off with the intense moment when she causes the blackout people panicking and screaming etc. like the opening. I like checkmarks. I like the checkmark demo a LOT. However, you shouldn't be using a demo for the entire closing - you reduce your presence by like 70% (i made up the number) because you become a tiny box on my screen. Not a fan of the blackout/guilty demos. Think of demos as a tool to help your presentation, not a replacement for them. I appreciate the reactiveness to the witness drinking during trial. Unfortunately being on the screen as a tiny box meant it was difficult for me to see your hand gestures and mastery of the zoom box.	3	nice reaction to their theme, I appreciate that a lot. strong structure going into this. good explanation of the burden. hand gestures are waving around a lot though. some of this is straight from Iain lampert's 2014 finals closing? .... not a good look.	62	136	168	52	160	55	164	51	161	167	t
